## Cold Front
*For all possible perks, check out **Cold Front** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1506719573/cold-front/)*

Cold Front is a 750 RPM Aggressive Frame ("High damage, high recoil") Kinetic Submachine Gun, first introduced long ago during the Season 9 Dawning event. It's back once again with a whole new set of perks from Year 4. If you want to see the old perks, here's a still from [Aztec's review](https://youtu.be/ZK1JPaCASnQ?t=166) in 2019.

[Cold Front Is Back & BETTER Than Ever! (Best Destiny 2 Primary?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG3C1TDUzA8) - Ehroar

> *I believe it's one of the best primaries in the game for PvE* -- Ehroar, Dec. 2020

[IF YOU HAVENT GOT THIS SMG, YOU NEED IT, Cold Front Dawning SMG God Roll Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sFhMUMMttk) - Blyatnid 

> *I have a reason to believe this is the new best primary in the game, full stop* -- Blyatnid, Dec. 2020

Ehroar and co. are excited for a couple of reasons. First, Cold Front has an (obviously) higher rate of fire than its 600 RPM counterpart without being all that much different stat-wise (save for Stability of course). It can also  roll with the new damage-boosting perk `One for All` which we'll get to down in the PvE section below.

If you remember the Cold Front from last year, you'll recall its Stability is one of the lowest in the game at `16`. Technically that's "better" than Hard Truth's `15` though not by much. This is less of an issue on PC than Console, though it's still an issue. However, this time around we have two new tools at our disposal: `Surplus` and `Dynamic Sway Reduction`.
### Cold Front - PvP/PvE Double Duty
The cornerstones of both PvE and PvP are `Surplus` and `Dynamic Sway Reduction`. The best PvE and PvP rolls center around having one of these perks in column three. If you end up with a "PvE roll" that also happens to have super high Stability, then you've got the Holy Grail of Cold Front rolls. Congrats! For an explanation of these rolls, please read further down towards the specific PvE and PvP sections.

These rolls are floored at `36` Stability (before `Surplus`) since that's the base Stability of other similar SMGS (e.g. Ikelos).

*Yes, these rolls are all based on quotes from the great [Dr. Victor Fries](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000216#quotes).*
#### **Endless Winter**
`Surplus` + `One for All` + all the `Stability` you can get.

### Cold Front - PvP
You'll notice I didn't include any final column perks. Rampage doesn't meaningfully realistically alter the TTK and Thresh adds so little to your super that it's not worth calling out as the Collector's Edition. Whatever you get in that final column is fine.
#### **Ice to See You/Surplus**
Cold Front needs a lot of help in the Stability department, which is the entire focus of this roll. At best, you'll be able to get Stability up from `16` to `51` plus the benefits coming from Surplus. This puts you way above the base Stability on the vaunted Antiope-D and other Precision Frame SMGs. The Recoil is `92` so be sure to throw on a Counterbalance mod if you don't end up with a +Recoil barrel.

### Cold Front - PvE
With the addition of `Surplus` and `One for All` to the Cold Front perk pool, we're looking at a strong contender for one of the best kinetic weapons of all time. `Surplus` improves Stability and Reload (two big Cold Front drawbacks) and `One for All` provides a tremendous damage boost and leaves your mod slot free for Minor, Major or Boss Spec.

***`Dragonfly` is going to be replaced by `Swashbuckler` so when you see `Dragonfly` below, you know what it means. The wishlist will be updated after Destiny is updated.***
#### **Blizzard**
While `Surplus` will be boosting Stability, the Stability is so low and difficult to manage on console that we'll continue to crave it as a backstop for when we're at lower tiers of `Surplus` benefits.

## Glacioclasm
*For all possible perks, check out **Glacioclasm** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1030895163/glacioclasm/)*

The Glacioclasm is a High-Impact Frame Fusion Rifle released for the first time in The Dawning, 2020 (Y4 S12). Implicit in the High-Impact frames are that you gain accuracy while crouched: "more accurate when stationary and aiming down sights".

Here are some highlights called out from [CoolGuy's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcKyglpE5UI):

  * Base 1.6 Zoom, versus 1.5 on all other Fusions
  * Best Handling and Stability of all High-Impact Frames
  * Base Range of `67`, "Already at the cap; you don't need any more. It's
  near perfect for the Range that fusions have right now [after the range
  compression nerf]."

From [Fallout's Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7URG6BUl_Q), the difference between a "low range" (67) and "high range" (89) setup is that you gain a single meter before falloff, from 17-18m. That's likely why CoolGuy and Fallout suggest investing in Stability.
### Glacioclasm - PvP
As mentioned above, the Glacioclasm's base stats are some of the best ever for a High-Impact frame. Because of this, we can narrow our focus on perks and go for some amazing rolls in a post-Erentil world. This is a controller wishlist and so these rolls will primarily focus on `Stability` (which is probably also fine for M&K but apparently M&K players aren't into Fusions as much?)

I [put together a chart](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/wiki/Weapon-Focus-Fusion-Rifles) from Fallout's video above and after some helpful Guardians let me voop 'em in a private match.
#### **Accelerated Four-Bolter**
This roll is based around the combination of `Accelerated Coils` and `High-Impact Reserves`. This will allow you to four-bolt Guardians at `9` Resilience with two in the mag (i.e. when you spawn in). I have no Resilience statistics, but checked across three games last night and most people were `2`-`3` with a few around `5`. If you happen to get `Chambered Compensator` be sure to throw on a Counterbalance mod to hit `Recoil:100`.

#### **Stable Four-Bolter**
Similar to the above, swapping in `Particle Repeater` to replace `Accelerated Coils`, but still centering around `High-Impact Reserves`. Because the Charge Time is slower you can now four-bolt Guardians at any `Resilience` value.

#### **Jittery Four-Bolter**
There is a unique situation among rolls here that's super interesting. If you have a `Charge Time` Masterwork and `High-Impact Reserves` it means you can four-bolt Guardians at `6` Resilience with two in the mag. That's actually a downgrade from not having a `Charge Time` Masterwork... but(!) you get an upgrade with one in the mag in that you can now four-bolt Guardians with **any** Resilience.

#### **Slow and Steady Four-Bolter**
This roll is based around `Liquid Coils`, which allows you to four-bolt Guardians at `9` Resilience. The introduction of `Liquid Coils` opens this roll up quite a bit. You won't find a `Charge Time` Masterwork here because it would drop the roll down to `6` Resilience.

## Black Scorpion-4sr - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Black Scorpion-4sr** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/525750263/black-scorpion-4sr/)*


[CoolGuy's review (8/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY) is great source of info for the Black Scorpion, as well as the Massive  Breakdown Podcast [Ep. 148](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-148-bygones-last-perdition-and-black-scorpion-4sr-breakdowns). There are seven perks in the final two columns (versus the usual four to six) and during Season 9, this weapon does not benefit from the Rank 92 extra-final-column-perk bonus. That means these rolls are going to be super challenging to get, so we're going to relax a few constraints along the way.
* Recoil is `60`, so using a Counterbalance mod to make it vertical is a slam dunk. Check out CoolGuy's video for a [before/after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY&t=400).
* All these rolls will recommend Rampage in the final column because "Rampage x 1 will kill with four crits in 0.7s."
* The base Range hits max damage at 68m which you're not going to find often on a PvP map, so we're OK with it. We don't want to harm the range, but this roll isn't dying for more range. Mercules904 - "The 2x zoom blows through your range requirements. I really just like this gun more with a heck of a lot of Stability."
* Zen Moment? YES. Stability is where our focus will be. Zen Moment gives you a bump to your base Stability which you can see [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability is a terrific `54`, the highest among all Scout Rifles (?!).
* No Outlaw? NOPE. The reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS perk to play off of in column three. It's not bad, it's just not make-or-break.

Check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnJWuiUF2k) and [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black Scorpion in action. I was surprised to hear how much Mercules904 digs the Black Scorpion (it's the weapon he used to get Randy's).
* **(PvP) Mercules Collector's Edition 💪⭐️ - 0.1% chance**: Let's call this the "Mercules" roll, since listening to the podcast linked above informed its creation. All Stability, all day, with better Aim Assistance and mobility from `Moving Target`. Because of the quantity of perks in the final two columns, your chance of this roll is... slim.

## BrayTech Werewolf - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **BrayTech Werewolf** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/528834068/braytech-werewolf/)*


The BrayTech Werewolf is a 450 RPM "Precision Frame" Kinetic Auto Rifle first introduced in Season 8. It's now available in the 2020 [Festival of the Lost](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/Events/FestivalOfTheLost) event, with random rolls. The only competitive AR archetype right now are the 600s, so you're gambling on an eventual sandbox change for this to be more effective in PvP.

Obtaining this Auto Rifle is a pretty grim affair, behind three levels of RNG:
1. You need Cipher Decoders to drop, which they **have a chance of** doing do at the end of most activities (Ordeal, Strike playlist, Crucible, etc.).
1. You need the Werewolf to drop from a Haunted Forest chest. The chance appears to be something between "never" and "20%" with most folks reporting closer to 5-10%. There's a thread on [/r/DestinyTheGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/jaeitx/horror_story_werewolf_drop_rate_is_2025_chasing/) about it.
1. You need to get the roll you're chasing.

While you are more than welcome to run and grind for these, keep in mind that once you obtain a single drop, you can pull a very good PvE static roll from your collections. Given that 450 RPM ARs haven't been competitive in PvP since Year 1 of Destiny 2, you're prrrobably not missing on much.
* **(PvP) "Werewolves not Swearwolves" 🐺🐺🐺🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.0% chance**: With completely vertical recoil and loads of Stability, this will be an absolutely shredder should 450s get a buff. Hell and even if they don't, you'll do pretty decent work with it. All rolls in this set will feature `Dynamic Sway Reduction` and `Tap the Trigger`.

## Bygones - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Bygones** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2712244741/bygones/)*


You don't actually need all that much for a "great" Bygones roll because, well, it's just a solid weapon at its baseline. Throw on a Counterbalance mod to bring the recoil to `84` and you're golden. You can see [Fallout's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) for reference. Just recently CoolGuy  [updated his prior review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwMBASjJDwQ) of Bygones and those thoughts have been incorporated in to the rolls below.

Why bother with Bygones in 2020? It's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault!

Here's what's forming the foundation of these rolls:

* Consider using a +10 Recoil barrel perk and a Counterbalance mod (+15) to get the Recoil to 94 which is nearly vertical with a slightly left pull. Arrowhead Brake will get us to 99 Recoile without a CB mod but you're sacrificing the stability and range benefits of those other barrels. That being said, it would free up your mod slot for something like Targeting Adjuster or Rampage Spec.
* Handling is solid, among the highest of pulse rifles, so we're not too concerned about raising this.
* With [recent findings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkJYoL6E1U) that Slideshot activates for two seconds (some of which you lose while the slide completes), I'm tossing it out for a great roll here. With a long-range, precision weapon like a pulse rifle, you're going to maybe get one burst off before Slideshot dissipates.
* I am requiring Kill Clip because I don't believe the raw kill potential with no upside for stringing makes this worth keeping. There are far too many other primaries with great follow-up perks like MKC and Swashbuckler kicking around nowadays.

If you want to see a Stability-focused roll do work, check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXmwYjWW4TE). He's using Corkscrew + Ricochet + Stability MW.
* **(PvP) CoolGuy "Perfected" Collector's Edition 😎 - 0.1% chance**: CoolGuy: "This is a safe bet. It's a roll you'll be able to pull out a year from now and do well with." Arrowhead Brake means your recoil is at 99 and you can skip the Countbalance mod.

The idea is that you empty the mag and use Slideshot to reload it, so that you can 2-tap most guardians. Completely gimmicky and will absolutely shock anyone you run into :)

## Bygones - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Bygones** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2712244741/bygones/)*


The perk pool for Bygones is from 2018, so we lose out on some of the barn burners like Multikill Clip, Swashbuckler and Vorpal.

Why farm for one? Well, it's the only 390 RPM kinetic Pulse Rifle and the only other randomly rolled one apart from Last Perdition and the raid pulses. If this archetype gets buffed, it will be nice to have one in your vault.
We're going for sustained DPS and maximum range. Stability is already high enough and PvE enemies don't move around as much so you can more easily control recoil. You can always throw on a Counterbalance mod on if you find it kicks too much. If you end up with a Rampage roll, don't forget to put a Rampage Spec mod on it!
* **(PvE) Super Picky - 1.1% chance**: Standard DPS roll from years' past, and as per usual with PvE rolls, as much damage as you can get then as much range as you can get.

  ```

## Gnawing Hunger - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Gnawing Hunger** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/821154603/gnawing-hunger/)*


Gnawing Hunger is a 600 RPM "Adaptive Frame" Energy Auto Rifle first introduced in Season 6. It has been reissued in Season 11, meaning it will be capable of going up to the Season 14 power level cap. Adaptives were buffed Season 10 and unless something changes, will remain very strong through Season 11.

For grins, [check out ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmbJdlYpD-s) using the generally agreed-upon "God roll" roll with `Tap the Trigger`, `Kill Clip` and a Stability Masterwork.
> "Is there a bug with this gun or is it just really good? I feel like I'm killing too fast right now... like a little bit too fast. I don't get it."

> "This... it feels better than Summoner and SUROS. I can't believe there's a weapon like this in the game and I didn't know about it. I've never seen something like this."

> "Dude what is this TTK? I don't get it! This TTK is a little too fast Bungie."

I hopped in to the Tribute Hall and ran several Recoil pattern tests with various Barrels, Magazines, Perks and Masterworks (Arrowhead, Steady Rounds, Tap the Trigger, etc.). At base Stability and Recoil (on console at least), it's pretty hard to control.

There are two ways to get Gnawing Hunger to hone in for you:
1. **Tap the Trigger**: The most noticeable difference in bullet concentration comes from TtT. If you want a laser beam, you want TtT. That being said, if you *only* get TtT and no other Stability or Recoil perks, it's not nearly as easy to control as it could be.
2. **Arrowhead + Counterbalance**: This combo *absolutely works* as well. I was able to cluster rounds around small targets just fine, without TtT. If you don't get Zen Moment or Tap the Trigger in the third column, but you do get Arrowhead Brake in the first column, you might find it totally capable, especially if you're on PC.

What you **really** want is to slam all these perks together for maximum Stability and minimal Recoil, and that's what we're going to break down below.
* **(PvP) "Drifter Hungry" 🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.1% chance**: With a Counterbalance mod, this roll will be `Recoil:99` and once you apply the Masterwork, `Stability:71`. Layered on top of `Tap the Trigger`, it's a thing of beauty.

## Gnawing Hunger - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Gnawing Hunger** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/821154603/gnawing-hunger/)*


The best PvE roll of Gnawing Hunger is the curated one, and the only way to get it (as of Season 11) is via grinding T3 Reckoning.
If that's off the table, then classic combos will carry the day here - reload perks combined with damage boosting perks, and as much Range as we can get.
* **(PvE) Curated ‼️🌟🌟🌟🌟‼️ - 0.1% chance**: The curated roll! Overflow and Rampage let you kill enemies for hours¹ without reloading!  Arrowhead Brake gives you almost totally vertical recoil direction.  This is the best legendary auto for PvE in the game.
(¹ not actually hours, but 2x as long as normal)

## Honor's Edge - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Honor's Edge** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2857348871/honors-edge/)*


Honor's Edge (HE) is available in the World Drops loot pool in Season 11, originally being re-issued back in Season 10. The main difference between HE and SS14 is that HE can roll with `Surrounded` and `Flash Counter`, two both amazing perks.

* `Surrounded` + `Surrounded Spec` ends up giving you a massive 35% damage increase and since a Sword is in-your-face there's a high chance you'll proc this regularly.
* `Flash Counter` not only disorients but  [applies a 20% debuff](https://youtu.be/b9HcFqLdlyQ?t=1477)! This means *all incoming damange* is upped by 20%. You can imagine how helpful this would be in Public Events (like the S11 Contact event), to debuff the boss with up to eleven other Guardians attacking. The debuff lasts for five seconds, so you'll need to periodically switch to blocking for this to take effect. Given that every boss in the game stomps, this is a great way to take out your anti-stomp rage 😡


Fortunately the perk set is very small and chances are you'll get the roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll will keep you all the way through Season 13.

*Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the case*
* **(PvE) "Lawnmower Man" 🚜🚜🚜 Collector's Edition - 1.1% chance**: With Surrounded up, you'll be mowing through hordes of adds in no time. C/o [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/), Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed stat you won't notice the difference.

## Interference VI - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Interference VI** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2257180473/interference-vi/)*


The Interference VI (IVI) is not a Season 11 re-issue, but it is one of small number of weapons in the World Drop Power Weapon loot pool. Grenade Launchers haven't been meta PvE DPS for some time, so why record wishlist rolls for this? A couple of reasons:

* This reissued IVI can now roll Full Court. The only other GLs that can roll Full Court are `Doomsday` and `Love and Death`, both of which are capped at end of Season 11 (i.e. 1060PL). Full Court, at max range (> 50m) has a 25% damage increase. It's worth picking up!
* The perk pool is really small, with only four possibilities in the final two columns, which slightly offsets the number of perks in the first and second columns.
* While it's not a S11 re-issue (i.e. power cap of 1310 and not 1360), it will still be useful for the next two seaons, so if you get a decent roll then it will have some longevity to it.

The Power weapon pool is so small that you're going to buried under mountains of these. Chances are without even trying you're going to get a pretty decent roll. Enjoy your New Monarchy Grenader Launcher! :)
* **(PvE) "From Dooowwwwntown" 🏀🏀🏀Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: If the stars align, you'll get one that bumps Velocity as high as possible.

## Jian 7 Rifle - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Jian 7 Rifle** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1162247618/jian-7-rifle/)*


This Jian 7 is the randomly-rolled successor to the New Monarchy Pulse of the same name from days gone by. It's a 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle which is mostly the same as the Last Perdition which also rolls in this slot. The most important difference is that the Jian's base recoil is `80` which means that with a Counterbalance mod, it will be effectively perfectly vertical at `95`. Contrast with the Last Perdition whose base Recoil is `63` ( [detailed comparison](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BFRn3C;LQhzo) on light.gg)

It has notable perk placement differences; perks are mostly similar with some slotting variations. There are no Rampage-based perks here because it doesn't make it any easier to off enemies unless you're at x 2 which is too situational for a solid recommendation.

Everything written in the thoughts for [Last Perdition](#last-perdition---pvp) holds here as well, so I won't repeat all of that.
* **(PvP) Absurdly Planted 🌱🌱🌱 🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: `Firmly Planted` is criminally underrated. It's a difference in playstyle that you have to work at, but you will absolutely be rewarded. This perk alone is why the Jian 7 and Last Perdition have become two of my most-used pulses.

## Last Perdition - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Last Perdition** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/188882152/last-perdition/)*


A randomly-rolled 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle; here we go! If you like Bygones in the primary slot, Last Perdition is right up your alley. It was brought back in Season of the Drifter with random rolls, and it unfortunately kept a pretty baseline set of perks. There's so much magic happening in the Energy slot now that we're so deep into Destiny 2 that we're going to have a pretty high bar for rolls here.

Lots of resources for this one, including the [Destiny Massive Breakdowns](https://www.destinymassivebreakdowns.com/) [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns). I'll be quoting (or paraphrasing if I couldn't keep up :) Kyt_Kucha and Mercules904 quite a bit in here.
* Kyt: "Stability helps your Aim Assist cone recover more quickly. Recoil makes the bursts more linear but it's not the same thing as having more Stability."
* Kyt: "Wouldn't go with a zoom factor of less than 3 because otherwise you feel recoil too much"
* M904: "Accurized Rounds for +10 range, but maybe not if you picked a medium to high zoom scope (go for more Stability)"
* M904: "Remember that Range has a linear effect and Zoom has a multiplicative effect. Rangefinder is 0.1x zoom - be careful of it because it may push you too far. Using it with +2x SPO-26 would be a good combo. If you don't roll Rangefinder but you do roll a higher zoom scope, you can ignore Rangefinder. If you only have short-zoom scopes, use Rangefinder."
* CoolGuy's review: [Last Perdition 2.0 In Depth Review - Top Tier Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVNWTEttc) is terrific. Long zoom scopes aren't recommended because of the increased incoming flinch while ADS and they also decrease Handling which can make the weapon feel more sluggish. `Zen Moment` is capped out at 66% of Base Stability, which is super high at 66, so we're going to prioritize that.

For some general slaying footage, ZkMushroom loves his Last Perdition! Here he is on PC -  ["My Favorite Pulse Rifle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jXTmYiHbWQ) - and earlier on console - ["Last Perdition is the Best Pulse Rifle in the  Game?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwucqcnyX-s). "I don't like laning with pulses. I know Blast Furnace and Bygones will be better there. I like being aggressive with my pulse and this is the perfect one."
* **(PvP) Absurdly Sticky 🍭🍭🍭Collector's Edition - 0.8% chance**: With `Moving Target` and `Zen Moment`, your weapon should only produce yellow numbers. We'd also be thrilled to get `Firmly Planted` here!

When Last Perdition was brought back with random rolls in the Season of the Drifter, it came back with the standard perk pool from Destiny 2 Year 1. Not a ton of finesse here in the rolls we're looking for :)

## Night Watch - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Night Watch** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3504336176/night-watch/)*


Night Watch is a 200 RPM Scout Rifle that dropped during Season of the Drifter (S6). It has been re-issued in Season of Arrivals (S11) and is the only 200 RPM Scout Rifle in the game that is currently available. [CoolGuy's review (5/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1KGJ7WU9es) remains a great source of info for Night Watch. It's a bit over a year old, but the sandbox hasn't changed materially around 200 RPM Scouts (for better or worse) or the perks he talks through.

200 RPM Scouts (including the Night Watch) are far from meta. Even the strongest of the bunch (MIDA) you never see. The maps aren't really designed for Scouts, perhaps save for Rusted Lands? and 200 RPM Scouts struggle against the powerhouses like Jade Rabbit.

And now the section where I feel like I have to justify not just picking Outlaw + Rampage/Kill Clip on every weapon in the game 😃

* I am not suggesting Outlaw because the base `Reload` is already plenty fast. Outlaw isn't bad here per se, there's just not a strong reason to choose it.
* Conversely, I am suggesting Rapid Hit because even though it was [changed in S11](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49126), it's still a solid perk.
* I am not suggesting Rampage because at x1 it does not alter the TTK (it does at x2).
* Conversely, I am suggesting Multikill Clip because it does alter the TTK (3H1B > 3H0B).

Similar to my thoughts on 180 RPM Hand Cannons, I do think Explosive Rounds is very strong here. The explosions have no damage falloff and with the high rate of fire, it means your target is constantly flinched (almost annoying so). Here's a  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0uI-KZnD70) from Drewsky demonstrating how High Caliber Rounds and Explosive Rounds work.
> "[Explosive Rounds] made the crosshairs jerk horizontally while rising and reaching its peak resulting in more irregular and disorienting flinch patterns [than High-Caliber Rounds]."

This was the same basis of my suggestion for Explosive Rounds on the Patron of Lost Causes back in Season of the Dawn (S9). I think it's similarly strong here, especially in sixes where you're likely to get additional assist points from Explosive Rounds when people are clumped together.

Because of the high RPM, I'm also going to suggest we shoot for as much `Stability` as we can get to increase the recovery of the Aim Assist cone between shots.

## Stars in Shadow
*For all possible perks, check out **Stars in Shadow** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2050789284/stars-in-shadow/)*

Stars in Shadow is a 340 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Energy Pulse Rifle introduced in Destiny 2 Year 4 (Beyond Light). See [how it compares](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=B6PI-k;BIfK-Z;BFN60K;) to the existing High-Impacts that lit up in Season 11. It's a Crucible drop and if you're an avid PvP player, you'll be swimming in these rolls in no time. It's a solid Pulse Rifle with good base stats, a clean sight and a great feel. I'm sure you'll see more coverage in the coming weeks as people settle in to Beyond Light and Season 12.

***"Why are the odds for these rolls so low?"*** The final two columns typically have four to six perks in them. In the case of Stars in Shadow, they each have twelve.

***"Why don't you have any rolls with Thresh?"*** Thresh doesn't seem to be all that game-changing (1-3% Super bonus on kill) and doesn't synergize with other perks, so we're skipping it.
### Stars in Shadow - PvP
These rolls are going to be similar to those we captured in our coverage of [Cold Denial](#cold-denial---pvp) as it's a comparable 340 RPM.

***"Why don't you have any Outlaw or Feeding Frenzy PvP rolls?"***

Good question! Glove mod slots are inexpensive and not contentious in PvP. If you want much faster reload, throw on a two-Energy Pulse Rifle Reload mod. Feeding Frenzy was changed to provide a noticeable benefit after three successive kills, so I no longer recommend it for PvP.
#### **Vertical/Dark Side**
This set of rolls is all about maxing out Recoil, and keeps `Arrowhead Brake` constant as our barrel. You have the option of achieving `100` Recoil by slotting in a Counterbalance mod. If not, go nuts with your nearly perfectly vertical `94`. `Killing Wind` is S-tier and you'd be happy to get any of the final column perks.

#### **The Vertical/Hoarder**
This set of rolls pivots around `Surplus`. It provides a roughly 25%, 13% and 8% boost depending on how many abilities are charged. You really want to be shooting for all three abilities charged at once which means either foregoing their use entirely or perhaps investing in high tiers of the respective stat (Strength, Discipline, or <class stat>) so that you can quickly recharge a single one. The tradeoff is going around with a supercharged weapon the whole match.

In PvE you're going for as much `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. There are some solid perks here not in our rolls, becase you don't need this wishlist to tell you that Demolitionist is a good perk 🙃

All Range and all damage.

## Steel Sybil Z-14 - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Steel Sybil Z-14** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4230993599/steel-sybil-z-14/)*


The Steel Sybil is a re-issue of the Crucible sword from the launch of Forsaken back in Season 4. The perks are the same as they've always been so unfortunately this Season (Season 11) will be about (re?)chasing your best roll from the past nearly two years. Whomp whomp.

Fortunately the perk set is very small and chances are you'll get the roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll will keep you all the way through Season 14.

"But Slif, Falling Guillotine is void and is way better DPS. Why would I keep a Steel Sybil around?" Great question, let's turn it over to Joe:
> Futureproofing if they better differentiate the role of the two frames. But given the small sword perk pool, it's never really been hard to scrounge up a serviceable weapon at the time you need it. I'd imagine guillotine will become better for wide damage, sybil better for single target. But as of today, you only need guillotine.

Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the case :)
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS 🗡🗡🗡 Collector's Edition - 2.7% chance**: With Whirlwind and Relentless you'll be slicing for what seems like forever. C/o [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/), Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed stat you won't notice the difference.

  ```
  Barrels [ 40%]: Jagged Edge
  Mags    [ 40%]: Swordmaster's Guard
  Perks 1 [ 50%]: Relentless Strikes
  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Whirlwind Blade
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS 🗡🗡 (Minus Magazines) - 6.7% chance**: Same as the CE, minus Heavy Guard. That's OK because you won't be doing all that much defending while slicing away with your sword.

## Timelines' Vertex - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Timelines' Vertex** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3055192515/timelines-vertex/)*


This Timelines' Vertex is the randomly-rolled successor to the Future  War Cult version of the same name from days gone by. While it uses a reskinned version of the Erentil, it is unfortunately not also a High- Impact Frame. Fusions had a pretty nasty nerf in S11, discussed in [roll comments](#hollow-words---pvp) on the Hollow Words.

Since it's an Adaptive Frame, you need 6/7 bolts to hit and if you want  to OHK it needs to be within 17m, which is pretty darn close and pretty darn difficult when you factor in opponent mobility. SMGs and sidearms are arguably more effective within this range because they give you more mobility options and can more readily be used against mobile opponents. Increasing the Range will not increase falloff for Fusions at the moment.

I can only really reccomend this type of Fusion Rifle to aficionados.
* **(PvP) Shieldbreaker 🛡🛡🛡 🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.1% chance**: If you're able to OHK, terrific! If not, chances are you're at least breaking shields and with a quick swap to a primary, you have an interesting combo. Typically I would go for more Stability but you're getting all of that from Firmly Planted so we can opt for Range perks where we can.

## Truthteller - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Truthteller** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1946491241/truthteller/)*


If you're a member of the [Fighting Lion Club](https://www.fightinglion.club/) or are looking for a replacement once your Mountaintop can no longer be infused, give Truthteller a try.

Truthteller is part of the "Lightweight Frame" grenade launchers (breach-loaded, single shot). Lightweight grenade launchers all have a "remote detonation" ability where they detonate when you release the trigger (or you get a direct hit). These weapons have a very high skill ceiling, allowing banked shots and shots that explode next to enemies in cover.

In PvP, this weapon excels at starting engagements rather than finishing them. We want Truthteller to soften our enemies up, even if we don't get a direct hit.

There are a couple of perks that help us meet this goal:
- Auto Loading Holster - be ready for that next engagement with a fully loaded weapon
- Disruption Break - breaking an opponents shield gives kinetic weapons a 50% buff.
   Quick swapping to a kinetic primary ammo weapon will allow for quick cleanup (likely
   a one-shot/one-burst)


I'll be pairing this with the `Quick Access Sling` mod as it'll proc with every shot and let us more quickly clean up what we've started.
* **(PvP) "Sheildbreaker" 🛡🛡🛡🌟 Collector's Edition - 1.1% chance**: Break their shields with Disruption Break and clean them up with a kinetic. We're looking for velocity and blast radius here.

  ```
  Barrels [ 85%]: Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Linear Compensator, Hard Launch
  Mags    [ 80%]: Spike Grenades, Proximity Grenades, High-Velocity Rounds
  Perks 1 [ 20%]: Auto-Loading Holster
  Perks 2 [ 20%]: Disruption Break
  MWorks  [ 40%]: Velocity MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvP) "Shieldbreaker" 🛡🛡🛡 - Quite Picky - 2.7% chance**: Relaxed Masterwork but we really want Auto-Loading Holster and Disruption Break with velocity and blast radius focused barrels and magazines.

  ```
  Barrels [ 85%]: Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Linear Compensator, Hard Launch
  Mags    [ 80%]: Spike Grenades, Proximity Grenades, High-Velocity Rounds

  Perks 2 [ 20%]: Disruption Break
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvP) "Shieldbreaker" 🛡Baseline - 4.0% chance**: Don't sweat the barrels, magazines, and masterworks too much, just get Auto-Loading Holster and Disruption Break.

  ```

## Truthteller - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Truthteller** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1946491241/truthteller/)*


In PvE there are a couple of roles that Truthteller can fill, and a number of great perks to look for.

Blinding grenades have a 10 meter radius on a 5 second suppression effect which works on all non-Ultra/Champion mobs.  In high-level PvE content, this can be really useful for suppressing a large area and having an entire fireteam do damage without worrying about retaliation.  [Ehroar](https://youtu.be/8cA0X0yptco?t=70) calls Blinding Grenades:

> Blinding Grenades are one of the most underrated pieces of utility in the game...[Truthteller] is something I'm going to definitely consider taking into the next raid.

As of Season 11, it feels like there's some sort of bug or issue with Concussion Grenades.  They have the same -50 penalty to blast radius of Blinding Grenades and also have the same 5s duration to the effect, but their area of effect is only a 5 meter radius (~25% of the total area impacted).

Spike Grenades can also be good if you're looking to do direct damage.  Truthteller isn't quite at Mountaintop levels of damage, but it's probably the best thing we have as a replacement.   In testing, Mountaintop with Spike Grenades does 21,048 damage.  Truthteller with Spike Grenades does 15,185, so about 28% less.

Auto-loading Holster is the best 3rd column perk for almost every situation, the only possible exception is using Field Prep and crouching for faster reload if you're looking to spam this weapon.

Normally, damage boosting perks like Swashbuckler and Multi-Kill clip are highly sought after on weapons, but for this archetype, it's fairly hard to keep those chains going enough to make them worth their while.

Demolitionist is the best 4th column PvE pick as it has the dual effect of increasing the number of grenades you get, and filling the chamber with a shell after throwing a grenade.

Disruption Break is also viable and for some situations would be amazing to help bring a tough blinded enemy down (now if Bungie would ever allow grenade launchers to have an Anti-Barrier mod, this would be _amazing_).

This weapon is void and works really well for Voidlocks running Nezarac's Sin.  I've had a lot of fun pairing it with Falling Guillotine (also void) and Bad Juju for very fast grenade and super regeneration.  Add in some mods like Blast Radius (get Charged with Light for GL kills), Lucent Blade (extra sword damage), Protective Light (50% damage received when your shield breaks), Dire Artillery (extra super on GL kills), and Oppressive Darkness (enemies take 35% more damage).   This is the build I'll be running for the rest of the season.
* **(PvE) "Blinded by Science" 🧪🧪🧪🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: Open up an engagement on a group of enemies by suppressing them all with blindness

## Bite of the Fox - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Bite of the Fox** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3169616514/bite-of-the-fox/)*


Bite of the Fox is a Kinetic-slot, Aggressive Frame sniper. It's been in the Iron Banner loot pool since Season 4 and has been re-issued in Season 11. This means if you *had* a BOTF, it will hit the level cap this season, so you'll want to get a new roll to take you past Season 11.

Aggressive Frame snipers are the only ones that can one-shot every super in the Crucible. Every super has a different damage-resistance tier that affects your ability to do that however Aggressive Frames do not care about such things.

The perk pool is unchanged in the re-issue, so we have a pretty simple set of rolls we're chasing.

With respect to PvE below, there's no Triple- Tap, Fourth Time's the Charm, Vorpal, etc. so I'd suggest you use something else in PvE in the Kinetic slot. If you absolutely had to have one, maybe [`Firmly Planted` + `Field Prep`]?
* **(PvP) "Snappy Opener" 🤞🤞🤞🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.3% chance**: This series of rolls is based around Snapshot and Accuracy-increasing final-column perks. After that, we're looking for as much `Range` and `Handling` as we can get.

## Crimil's Dagger - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Crimil's Dagger** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4292849692/crimils-dagger/)*


Crimil's is a 110 RPM Kinetic, Aggressive Frame Hand Cannon that has been re-issued in Season 11 with a higher power cap. It features the same perk pool its always had and since 110s haven't been touched over the years dince Destiny 2's launch, it's going to be a pretty limited set of perks we're interested in.

I wouldn't call 110s the meta (far from it) or really all that competitive at the moment. My guess is that new perks will appear on these to create interesting or alternative options, because the 110s hit so hard it would be tough to imagine how they could otherwise make them stronger without unbalancing them.

There is one niche where they **really** shine, and that's if you want to use them for cleanup kills after zinging someone with a bow or sniper body shot. They are the only Hand Cannon archetype where a crit can OHK-cleanup in that playstyle. In terms of 1:1 duels, they punish you for missing and you will not adequately flinch your opponents compared to ARs, 150 HCs, Pulses, etc.
* **(PvP) "Magnetic Bullets" 🧲🧲🧲🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.0% chance**: One of the rare weapons that can roll with both `Moving Target` and `Opening Shot` at the same time. The 110s have a punishing kick so after that, we're going for `Stability`.

The perk pool here is before the new good stuff started rolling out, so there's not too many surprises. The only damage-dealing perk is `Kill Clip` but we have a few ways to reload quickly.

Part of the added challenge with these old weapons is that the perk pools are so large the chances of getting what you want is quite low.

## Fool's Remedy - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Fool's Remedy** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/65611680/the-fools-remedy/)*


Fool's Remedy is "SUROS Rapid-Fire" (i.e. fully automatic) 450 RPM Sidearm that has been re-issued in Season 11's Iron Banner. The Remedy is the only SUROS-RF sidearm in the game apart from `Dead Man Walking` whose power cap is the current Season (11).

If you're going to chase a single weapon from Season 11 Iron Banner (thus far), the Fool's Remedy is the one to go for. People are raving about it because of how it performs at base, its available perks, and that those perks now include the new Iron Banner specific perks: `Iron Gaze` and `Iron Grip`.

* Aztecross - ["Fools Remedy Review (Fantastic Sidearm)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOqRgxg1dIA)
* Destiny Fun Police - ["The Fools Remedy - Returning Iron Banner Sidearm"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zeeXHNls1M)
* IFrostBolt - ["The Must Have Sidearm (Fool's Remedy)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6qeCktTYY)
* MTashed - ["This Sidearm Suprised Me! The Fool's Remedy Iron Banner Sidearm"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmIhv_j7Yuo)
* TrueVanguard - ["This New Iron Banner Sidearm is NUTS"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frkRY-HSUQE)

As is pleasantly becoming the norm in Season 11, it's hard to pick a single "god roll" for this sidearm. We're trending towards a lack of unequivocally "best" rolls (or even best-per-input-type) and that's going to make the Destiny sandbox a lot more interesting, especially as the first batch of weapons sunset this season.

We're going to proceed with these starting from the last perk and working our way backwards. I agree with CoolGuy that the two most important perks are the final columns and you build the rest of the roll around them. Fortunately there are so many great possibilities here, you stand a good chance of landing multiple rolls!
* **(PvP) "In my Sights" 👓👓👓🌟 Collector's Edition - 1.0% chance**: Working backwards from `Iron Gaze` (+20 AA), we're going for as much `Stability` as we can. We'd end choosing the rest of the roll similarly if we landed `Kill Clip` or `Eye of the Storm` in the final slot, so we'll combine these rolls.

## Orewing's Maul - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Orewing's Maul** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2108920981/orewings-maul/)*


Orewing's is almost identical to the [Truthteller](#truthteller---pvp) in every way, save for a much less excellent perk pool. Truthteller has more interesting combinations, but if you're swimming in GL's from Iron Banner and really want to keep one, read on.

[Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXhfIXnPTT4) (aka DFP) first popularized these back in Year 1 of Destiny 2 when he used the Fighting Lion to great affect.

Like Truthteller, Orewing's is part of the "Lightweight Frame" grenade launchers (breach-loaded, single shot). Lightweight grenade launchers all have a "remote detonation" ability where they detonate when you release the trigger (or you get a direct hit). These weapons have a very high skill ceiling, allowing banked shots and shots that explode next to enemies in cover. In PvP, these weapons excel at starting engagements rather than finishing them. We want Orewing's to soften our enemies up, even if we don't get a direct hit.

Let's talk perks, and why you probably want a Truthteller instead ;)
* **Column 2**: Here you have a choice between `Spike`, `Blinding` and `Concussion` grenades. Blinding grenades flash your screen white and slowly subside whereas Concussion grenades jerk your camera dramatically, like being hit by a tether. Either Concussion or Blinding grenades are bugged because Blinding's radius is massive whereas Concussion requires a near direct hit. With such a wide radius, you can practically gaurantee that you'll be able to blind folks in PvP so I tend to suggest `Blinding`. What about `Promixity`? The proximity detonation radius is so miniscule that you may as well use `Spike` if you're that accurate. Firing at enemies in the Tribute Hall and you have to give them a buzz cut for `Proximity` to proc.
* **Column 3**: Only one perk in this column has utility in PvP and that's `Quickdraw`.
* **Column 4** : Only one perk in this column has utility in PvP and that's Auto-Loading Holster. `Rangefinder`, `Moving Target` and `Snapshot` don't help us at all, because you're always hip-firing. `Demolitionist` only procs on kills and we're using these to open, not to close. If you get any other perk than ALH in this slot, it will unfortunately go to waste.

In the immortal words of [@tednaleid](https://github.com/tednaleid) "I'm not sure why Bungie created both of these weapons" and it's true! It's hard to see why you'd run an Orewing's over a Truthteller. Heck it's hard to see why you'd run an Orewing's at all given the two most important slots have near zero utility in PvP.

Remember to pair this with the `Quick Access Sling` mod as it'll proc with every shot and let us more quickly clean up what we've started.

## The Steady Hand
*For all possible perks, check out **The Steady Hand** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2220884262/the-steady-hand/)*

The Steady Hand (TSH) is a 120 RPM "Aggressive Frame" Kinetic Hand Cannon, re-issued in Year 4 with random rolls. Prior to Season 12 in November 2020, Aggressive Frames were bumped from 110 RPM to 120 RPM as part of a [large scale Hand Cannon rework](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49676). The general consensus thus far is that TSH is terrific.

> *The Steady Hand is probably the most consistent legendary 120 RPM aggressive hand cannon.* - Drewsky

* [Fallout - S-Tier Legendary Hand Cannon: Steady Hand GOD ROLL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46F_0m3r6GE)
* [Drewsky - The Steady Hand God Roll Is the Most Consistent Legendary Hand Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmdPE7KUrlQ)
* [DFP - THE STEADY HAND IS THE BEST 120 HAND CANNON!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--Pf0Uvpprg)
* [IFrostBolt - STEADYHAND = Run If You See This Hand Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RVzmlxjq-I)
* [The Steady Hand UPDATED Review (The God Rolls)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne0XkYP3joU)

What I love about these videos (and this set of perks) is that there is not absolute agreement on which roll is the best.

Iron Banner weapons tend to shine in PvP, so we won't feature many PvE builds.
### The Steady Hand - PvP
With Bungie's announcement that they can now have different falloff tiers across Hand Cannons (see patch notes above) the 120s are, perhaps oddly, now able to compete with Pulse Rifles. That, plus the fact that this is a controller-centric wishlist, means we'll be favouring Stability and Aim Assist perks.

> *You don't really need to worry about Range in my opinion so much on these hand cannons since they already have so much to begin with. Not to say it isn't valuable, but I think that it might be worth boosting other aspects of this weapon."* - Drewsky
#### **Locked On**
Moving Target and Iron Gaze are going to bump Target Acquisition immensely. You give up a few meters of damage falloff, and in return significantly increased accuracy.

#### **Demon of Sixes Street**
This is primarily a roll for sixes where TSH can shine as a cleanup weapon with a higher chance of chaining kills. Keep in mind that a `Resilience` of `5` cancels out the Swashbuckler two-tap from full health but in sixes that's not always what you're dealing with. If you can pair this with a ranged melee (Swashbuckler x 5) you'llI wouldn't suggest this roll for Comp or Trials.

#### **Float Like a Butterfly**
If you pair a Quickdraw TSH with a breach-load GL with a Quick Access Sling mod, you have a super powerful combination. Pairing it with Le Monarque has a similar effect: massive damage with an opening shot from your Energy weapon and a single shot from TSH to clean up. With Quickdraw and Snapshot, this Aggressive Frame can feel like a Lightweight.

### The Steady Hand - PvE
Generally in PvE you're going for as much `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. If you liked [The Duke Mk. 44](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2112909414/duke-mk-44/) then TSH could be for you.
#### **Rapid Reload**
Without Outlaw, you're going to have to rely on Transversives, Marksman's Dodge, etc. to reload effectively in PvE. Without it, you're looking at a lot of downtime in situations where there are better alternatives. This is the case with Outlaw-based Duke rolls and people absolutely loved that sooo 🤷‍♂️

## Swarm of the Raven - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Swarm of the Raven** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1972985595/swarm-of-the-raven/)*


For a moment in time, Swarm of the Raven was a legit DPS option. It's a Void Grenade Launcher and the buff from Tractor Cannon made it a beast. It's not super hot anymore, but why not secure yourself a good one just in case? Chances are without even trying you're going to get a pretty decent roll. Enjoy!

## Talons of the Eagle - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Talons of the Eagle** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1982711279/talons-of-the-eagle/)*


Talons of the Eagle is a 150 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Kinetic Scout Rifle. It originally appeared wayyy back in Season 4 (aka Forsaken). It's been recently re-issued in the first Season 11 Iron Banner. As part of this re-issue, the perk pool is unchanged, so we have years' worth of knowledge about how these work and years' worth of confusion as to why Scout Rifles can roll with `Threat Detector` and `Hip-Fire Grip`.

In order to beat out other long-range options in the Kinetic slot for PvP, I think you really want `Explosive Rounds` here. 150s are the slowest-firing, heaviest-hitting scouts but when you're competing against snipers and Arbalests, I think you need more flinch than they can put out at base.

The general drawbacks of 150s is their low `Stability` and `Handling` so we're going to address those as a secondary focus in all in all of our rolls.
* **(PvP) "Planting Bombs" 🌿🌿🌿💣🌟Collector's Edition - 0.0% chance**: `Firmly Planted` is terrific on long-range weapons like Pulse and Scout Rifles where you can post up in cover and peek shoot from a distance. There's also not much else terrific in that slot. Zen Moment is good, but Firmly Planted outclasses it.

## Heritage
*For all possible perks, check out **Heritage** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4248569242/heritage/)*

Heritage is a kinetic "precision frame" (slug) shotgun that can drop from the 2nd and 3rd encounters of the Deep Stone Crypt raid.  After the initial drop, you have a chance of getting additional rolls from the raid's secret chests.
As of Season 12, it is the only legendary kinetic slug shotgun that is viable in leveled content.
### Heritage - PvE
Slug shotguns currently enable some of the highest DPS in the game, and are the meta-loadout for boss DPS in a number of encounters, including the final boss of the raid.
#### **Re-Re-Re-Re-Combo Breaker!**
Reconstruction is a new perk that currently only drops on rolls from the DSC Raid.  Every 4 seconds it loads 10% of the base magazine from reserves into the gun, and it maxes out at 2x the normal magazine size.  It starts at a base of 6 (12) but with Extended Mag and the Backup Mag mod you can get up to 8 (16) shots without reloading!
None of the traditional damage perks (Rampage, Kill Clip, Vorpal) are available on this gun, so our best bet for the 4th column is another new perk, Recombination.  Final blows from all "elemental" sources (so, everything that isn't this shotgun) stack up to 10x.  Each stack will add 10% for the next Heritage shot (so up to 2x damage).
```

### Heritage - PvP
Heritage has the highest aim assist of any slug shotgun.  [Drewsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUGZIasUu9o) says "this weapon is really comparable to The Chaperone."
The base one hit kill range is 10.5 meters, you can increase that up to 11.9m with Killing Wind and Slideshot active.

All Range and all damage.

## Berenger's Memory - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Berenger's Memory** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/407621213/berengers-memory/)*


Season 11 is the first time we've seen Berenger's Memory since Destiny 2 Year 1 (i.e. Season 1). It's the first time it's been available with random rolls. Grenade Launchers haven't been meta PvE DPS for some time, so why record wishlist rolls for this?

It's part of the Umbral Engram pool, and part of a focused roll with the IKELOS Sniper, so you're likely to be swimming in these just by doing the weekly evac quests by the end of S11. Chances are without even trying you're going to get a pretty decent roll.
* **(PvE) "Forgetful" 🤔🤔🤔🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.5% chance**: If you want a GL for sticking 'nades on a boss, this is the roll for you. All GLs are basically the same these days, so this set of rolls applies for Outrageous Fortune, Swarm of the Raven, etc.

## Cold Denial - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Cold Denial** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1216130969/cold-denial/)*


Cold Denial is a 340 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Kinetic Pulse Rifle introduced in Season 11. See [how it compares](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BIfK-Z;C-tvt8;BFN60K;MZyyP) to the existing High-Impacts. The major difference might seem like a minor one, but check out the `Zoom:14` compared to the others with `Zoom:18`. The lower zoom means you've got a wider FOV while zoomed in, and that small(er) thumbstick movements don't kick your reticle as much. It makes way more of a difference than it might seem like on paper.

Everyone is covering this Pulse Rifle because it's absolutely amazing. Check out [Drewksy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKTOCEijawI&feature=youtu.be&t=119), [Mtashed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtJeiwwGII0), and [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1jKsnDD6Ss) and I'm sure you'll see more coverage in the coming weeks as more folks get their hands on various rolls.

The headline perk here is `Killing Wind`. The decent Stability and low Zoom factor downplay the need for the only other alternative: `Zen Moment`. Check out CoolGuy's review of [Killing Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go1TYsXCopc&feature=youtu.be&t=420) Here's are the benefits as he describes them:

* `Killing Wind` has a five second duration. Additional kills refresh the duration.
* It adds roughly five tiers of Mobility with the attendant benefits (strafe speed, etc.).
* It adds roughly a 4m increase in damage falloff.
      
* The Range boost it provides "is like a sustained version of `Opening Shot`".
   
* Handling increase is on par with Snapshot and vastly improved stow speed.

The last column is interesting. A handful of perks elevate the roll but in my opinion, none are essential. Headseeker might seem strange but with the High-Impact buff in S11, it means a 4H2B kill instead of 5H2B on 6 resilience or less. Think about it as making your initial engagement  more forgiving whereas Multikill Clip and Swashbuckler make your follow-on engagements more forgiving.
* **(PvP) Verticality 🏔🏔🏔🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: You have to see Cold Denial with 100 `Recoil` and bumped up Stability to believe it. It will require that you use a Counterbalance mod, which is par for the course on Scattershot weapons (Autos, SMGs, etc.). It's completely vertical and barely moves during the burst. This roll even without the Stability MW, felt broken when I used it; really nuts.

There's not much to puzzle out here. In PvE you're going for as much `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. I think `Unrelenting` is a super interesting perk, I would just prefer to have the large damage bonuses active from damage-boosting perks.

[Dark Drinker 2.0](https://youtu.be/W_ObIqaGhvM?t=305) is... sorry I mean Falling Guillotine... is a new "Vortex Frame" sword in S11. It does a [ridiculous](https://youtu.be/DxlrZnH7C1g?t=344) -  [amount](https://youtu.be/hWzifDFNww0?t=30) -  of -  [damage](https://youtu.be/SbBOCOJpMaE?t=103) and is also just [weird](https://youtu.be/YRcZ9IglcZM?t=31).

What makes this even better is that as with all other swords, the perk pool is super small, and with the Recaster perk `Umbral Enhancement III`, all of your Focused Umbral weapons get an additional final-column perk. As of this writing it appears to be bugged and I'm getting an extra final perk on unfocused drops 🤷‍♂️ (but also bugged in that I'm not getting a second perk on Cold Denial or Falling Guillotine 🤪) Chances are you'll get the roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll will keep you all the way through Season 14.

We're going for the classics here: Whirlwind and Surrounded. Maybe you'll get insanely lucky and get both Whirlwind and Surrounded as the perks in the final column?

*Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the case*
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS 🗡🗡🗡 🌟Collector's Edition - 2.7% chance**: With Whirlwind and Relentless you'll be slicing for what seems like forever. C/o [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/), Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed stat you won't notice the difference.

## False Promises - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **False Promises** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3143732432/false-promises/)*


False Promises is a 360 RPM Kinetic Auto Rifle introduced in Season 11. Apart from the Age-Old Bond (from the Last Wish raid), it's the only other High-Impact Frame Auto Rifle in the game that will be able to go past Season 11's `1060` power cap.

The High-Impacts are notable by their extremely long `Range` and extremely poor `Stability` and False Promises is no exception. On console, False Promises is pretty tough to control. Even with vertical `Recoil`, there's still a lot of bounce in the reticle because the `Stability` is so low.

I'm recommending, nay requiring `Dynamic Sway Reduction` for any False Promises roll I'd consider using in PvP, because of its marked affect on `Stability` and `Accuracy`. Here's what [Bungie had to say](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49126) about DSR prior to S11:

> **Dynamic Sway Reduction**: Adds 10 Stability over time in addition to accuracy (this is way more powerful than it sounds). Reduced reticle movement from Stability should now tell players this is working.

Here's a couple of videos examining Stability, including the effects of DSR. These were recorded before the aforementioned buff, so some of these may be a little out of date depending on which part of the content you're referring to.
* [Dynamic Sway Reduction on Auto Rifles & Zoom Effect | Destiny 2 Season of the Worthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S71_munFJYE)
* [Stability In Depth | Stat Review and Guide - The Heart of Destiny 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmQEFdjwzcw&feature=youtu.be)

All of the following rolls feature Eye of the Storm, Rampage and Swashbuckler. Think about this from a "forgiveness" perspective. If you want more forgiveness during your first exchange, choose Eye of the Storm. If you want more foregiveness during follow-on encounters, choose Rampage or Swashbuckler.

**Closing Remarks**: S11 continues the S10 600 RPM Auto Rifle meta. If you're planning on using an AR, I'd suggest any of the 600s kicking around, notably the Gnawing Hunger since it's so easily farmable via the Recaster. Alternatively, wait until The Summoner is up as the three-win reward in Trials and grab on there. As far as False Promises is concerned, I'll be holding on to a good PvP roll in the hopes that the sandbox is updated in S12 or beyond.
* **(PvP) Stormfront 🌦🌦🌦🌟Collector's Edition - 0.1% chance**: These 360s are primarily hampered by their ultra-low Stability, so we're going to do everything we can to correct it. `EotS` is part of that as it hones in progressively more as your health gets low. Be sure to swap in Counterbalance mod push the `Recoil` to `100`.

There's not much to puzzle out here. In PvE you're going for as much `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. I think `Unrelenting` is a super interesting perk, I would just prefer to have the large damage bonuses active from damage-boosting perks.

## First In, Last Out - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **First In, Last Out** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3616586446/first-in-last-out/)*


"First In, Last Out" was released for the first time in Season 11 since its initial drop at the launch of Destiny 2 - Season 1! It's the first time we've seen this with random rolls, so it does have a contemporary set of perks available (e.g. Demoiltionist and Vorpal). Once the gear-pocalypse hits after Season 11 and everything is sunset, it will be the only slug shotgun in the game apart from Chaperone.

All that being said, it's a solid weapon with some solid rolls. Absolutely down the fairway for the sandbox and shotguns - grab some range and accuracy perks and you'll be all set. Slug shotguns have always been an acquired taste and nothing about filo changes that. It's not amazing, it's not terrible; it can do great work in the right hands.
* **(PvP) Aztecross' "Hip Shooter" 🕺🕺🕺🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: To quote my friend Lenny, "This is the kind of stupid idea I am fond of." [Aztec's contention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj1tNWkP9Fg) is that slug shotguns struggle because of high enemy mobility combined with having to zoom means a much tighter field of view that makes them even harder to track. This is precisely why I stop using Chaperone around 4000 Glory in Comp. Hunters with high mobility (the stat and the skill to do so) and charging shotgun rushers become nearly impossible to hit (for me at least!). This is a series of rolls based around Hip-Fire Grip and Opening Shot. It's a totally different way of playing and I love the idea of it! I doubt it will become meta, but this list is all about fun, specific rolls so here you go 😃

## First In, Last Out - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **First In, Last Out** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3616586446/first-in-last-out/)*


In the 5/21/2020 TWAB, Bungie announced a surprising buff to slug shotguns:
> Slug Shotguns are underused in PvE, because they require crits to maximize damage, and didn’t reward that precision with higher damage per second: `Slug Shotgun PvE Damage + 30%`.

With this buff, they hit much harder and are totally viable in low- to mid-tier PvE. In high-tier PvE you tend not to sidle up to enemies but that's not the fault of slug shotguns :)
* **(PvE) "First In, Never Out" 🥾🥾🥾🚪🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.4% chance**: All of the reloading options are interesting in their own way, so we have one general set of rolls revolving around `Assault Mag` and `Surrounded`.

## Hollow Words - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Hollow Words** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/607191995/hollow-words/)*


Hollow Words is a "Precision Frame" 740ms-charge-time Fusion Rifle released in Season 11. That means it shoots seven bolts and you need five of those to connect for a OHK.
Fusions have been my favourite special since Destiny 1. I have an Erentil with 1,082 kills on it 😱Currently fusions are not in a good place in the sandbox after a sweeping nerf that just went in. If you want the complete story, check out [CoolGuy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYhJU9NN_iU). TL;DW: Range is [compressed](https://youtu.be/CYhJU9NN_iU?t=350), perhaps moreso than hand cannons were. The end result is steep falloff after 17m for all types, quickly pushing you out of reasonable OHK range.

With the effect of bumping Range so negligible, you're only left with Stability and Handling to focus on. Higher Stability will result in less bolt spread as the burst completes, which is why we're going to focus on it. 

So why are we here? Why even bother with PvP rolls of a Precision Frame when only High-Impacts are worth pursuing? Two reasons: `Killing Wind` and `Disruption Break`. Combined, you've got great benefits.
* **If you get a final blow** then `Killing Wind` procs and you can begin [mapping Guardians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qfhrTicLbU) at Erentil-like ranges with your Hollow Words.
* **If you only break their shields** then `Disruption Break` activates and you can quickly swap to your primary and finish them off.

Without both of these perks, you may as well run a High-Impact Frame. I think it's possible to have Killing Wind and a bunch of Range perks, but you don't need a wishlist to tell you to take a single perk ;)
* **(PvP) Windbreaker 🧥🧥🧥🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.3% chance**: Let's bring in as much Stability as we can paired with our two superstar perks. I'm also willing to forego Stability in the barrel if it means having completely vertical recoil w/Arrowhead.

## IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2222560548/ikelos-smg-v102/)*


The IKELOS SMG 1.0.2 is an Aggressive Frame, Energy-slot 750 RPM SMG. Back during the Warmind times (Season 3) its statically-rolled predecessor was a seriously legit part of the PvP meta. Apart from the original IKELOS SMG, in the history of Destiny 2, this archetype has had an unfortunate time of things. The only [other Aggressive Frames](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=CEeZUk;BZzrdV;GStUF;) have punishingly, unusably poor `Stability` so they never saw any play, not even on the fringes of the meta.

A few weeks into Season 11 an Bungie drops the new version of the IKELOS SMG, now called the IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 (compared to S3's V1.0.1). It now features random rolls with the new Y3 perks like Vorpal Weapon and Demolitionist. It also has a tremendous amount of Stability compared to its brethren, about triple.

* **`Seraph Rounds`**: The streamer~youtuberati are all abuzz about this perk. It has HCR built-in and does increased flinch! It increases Stability! It increases Range! One of those is correct - it does give a boost to damage falloff range. When I tested `Seraph Rounds` in the Tribute Hall, it pushed the range out by ~1m. Yep, a whole one meter. When I swapped in Accurized Rounds, it was basically the same, with a difference of less than a meter. I wouldn't  lose sleep about missing out on `Seraph Rounds`. Since this is a console wishlist and these Aggressive Frame SMGs have huge kick, we're going to prefer `Steady Rounds` and the attendant 38% increase in `Stability`.
* **`Threat Detector`**: The only evidence I've been able to find of how this perk works is present in this video: ["Threat Detector In Depth"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB7Fgvgchq8) which deduces a massive +20 to Stability at TDx1. The range for TDx1 is 14.8M (and below of course) which means a laser-like boost to Stability to where you could practically hip-fire the darn thing (no it does not drop with Hip-Fire Grip in its perk pool :)

Which set of rolls you go for depends on whether or not you want to keep your mod slot open for `Icarus Grip` or `Freehand Grip`. If you don't care for either of those, that's going to free up your choice of Barrels and you'll be able to throw a `Counterbalance Stock` mod in to fix the recoil.

Umbrals drop so regularly and since the season has been extended to November, I'm crossing my fingers you get the roll you want!
* **(PvP) "Rasputin's Choice; Mod Slot Free" 🤖🤖🤖🟢🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.1% chance**: Any time you see Dynamic Sway and Tap the Trigger available in both columns, that's a tough one to pass up. TtT keeps you steady on the initial burst and DSR keeps you steady afterwards. After that it's all `Stability`. This roll would push Stability from 39 to 74 (?!) and that's not including the additional Stability from DSR and TtT! With a Recoil-fixing Barrel, the mod slot is free for you.

## IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2222560548/ikelos-smg-v102/)*


Ehroar thinks the IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 might be the [best PvE primary in Destiny 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sgVvsCK2BM) mostly because it can generate Warmind Cells and it has a great perk pool. He makes a strong case and with Reach, the nukes are nukey.

Note that the IKELOS_SMG also has `Disruption Break` will will proc when breaking a Barrier Champion's shield. However no other perks play off of it, so I won't feature a set of rolls here for it. Same goes for `Demolitionist` which is a great perk but doesn't overtly synergize with any of the other perks. As Ehroar points out, `Subsistence` wrecks the reserves on the IKELOS, by a whopping 44% (!) so I'm not recommending it as a perk.
* **(PvE) "Seraph's Choice" 😇😇😇🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.1% chance**: Pair this roll with a `Surrounded Spec` mod and you are positively shredding through adds. Throw on a single Warmind Cell mod on to your armor and you become a nuclear bomb generating Guardian.

## IKELOS_SR_V1.0.2 - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **IKELOS_SR_V1.0.2** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1253087083/ikelos-sr-v102/)*


The IKELOS_SR_V1.0.2 is a 140 RPM Rapid-Fire Frame sniper. Stat-wise, the currently available batch are [mostly the same](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BKsJdr;o8g0X;DN5NWh;BLxysY) and unfortunately none can roll with both `Snapshot` and `Quickdraw` 😱 Note that the IKELOS does have a slightly higher Zoom (40 > 45) than half of the bunch. This may or may not work with your playstyle.

Let's get this out of the way - "What roll will replace my Beloved?" Unfortunately none of them. No 140 RPM sniper beyond the S11 power cap can roll like Beloved, Tatara Gaze, Apostate, etc. It looks like they're almost purposefully decoupling the great perks we're used to seeing together: Snapshot + Quickdraw, Snapshot + Opening Shot, etc.

Some thoughts on the perks I've selected:

* I value `Moving Target` over `No Distractions` for a few reasons. Contrary to the name, `Moving Target` procs [whether or not you're moving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcpJWC039m8). `No Distractions` takes 1.5-2s to activate. That is an eternity and basically unusable in Comp or Trials. Even when it does activate, `No Distractions` doesn't reduce flinch by that much. Here, check out [Fallout's testing](https://youtu.be/cUE4W03qPVY?t=171).
* `Seraph Rounds`, has just about every hidden benefit you can imagine ascribed to it. The only one I'm able to find definitive evidence for is that it increases range falloff by about 2m. When I compared it with `Accurized Rounds` on the IKELOS SMG, it pushed it about 1m further. That's the only reason I prefer it here, but they're basically the same in that one aspect. IMHO Bungie could definitely stand to redefine this perk if they're planning on keeping IKELOS weapons around.

There aren't a ton of great perks here, so I'm only featuring one roll with two variations: favouring `Handling` and favouring `Range`. 
* **(PvP) "Seraph Sharpshooter / Handling" 🎯🎯🎯🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: The IKELOS has `73` Aim Assist and with `Moving Target`, a `Targeting Adjuster` mod and `Enhanced Sniper Targeting` on your helm, you're plenty good on AA. Whatever tiny part of the `Range` stat affects AA is outweighed by faster Handling contributing to faster ADS and faster stow speed for cleanups.

* **(PvP) "Seraph Sharpshooter / Range" 🔭🔭🔭🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: The 140s tend to have quite high `Handling`. If you're solid with the base level of `Handling` maybe you prefer all-out `Range`? Let's keep the same set of rolls above and swap in`Range`-boosters. Some of the rolls overlap, so there will be fewer rolls here as they will be 'caught' by the above set of rolls.

Ehroar and Kackis both review the IKELOS 1.0.2 and land on similar reccomendations which I'll capture here. Ehroar's take is a little more thorough so I'm expanding the Collector's Edition with his thoughts.

The core perks are fine, so even though the Baseline is pretty easily obtainable, don't let that dissuade you; it's solid!

## Temptation's Hook - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Temptation's Hook** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/35794111/temptations-hook/)*


Temptation's Hook is an absolutely EN FUEGO Season 11 sword that has all the perks you'd have to get separately from Honor's Edge, Steel Sybil, Stryker's Sure-Hand, etc. It's got Surrounded, Flash Counter, Whirlwind Blade... AND VORPAL WEAPON folks!

What makes this even better is that as with all other swords, the perk pool is super small, and with the Recaster perk `Umbral Enhancement III`, all of your Focused Umbral weapons get an additional final-column perk. As of this writing it appears to be bugged and I'm getting an extra final perk on unfocused drops 🤷‍♂️ (but also bugged in that I'm not getting a second perk on Cold Denial or Falling Guillotine 🤪)

* "Why no roll w/`Whirlwind`?" If you're going up against hordes of adds, you'll benefit best from Surrounded (see below). If you want to whack on a single target, then this sword isn't the choice; you want Falling Guillotine instead.
* `Surrounded` + `Surrounded Spec` ends up giving you a massive 36% damage increase ("only" 25% w/out Spec) and since a Sword is in-your-face there's a high chance you'll proc this regularly. Classically great perk on swords.
* `Flash Counter` not only disorients but  [applies a 20% debuff](https://youtu.be/b9HcFqLdlyQ?t=1477)! This means *all incoming damange* is upped by 20%. You can imagine how helpful this would be in Public Events (like the S11 Contact event), to debuff the boss with up to eleven other Guardians attacking. The debuff lasts for five seconds, so you'll need to periodically switch to blocking for this to take effect. Given that every boss in the game stomps, this is a great way to take out your anti-stomp rage 😡


Fortunately the perk set is very small and chances are you'll get the roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll will keep you all the way through Season 14.

*Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the case*
* **(PvE) Swiss Army 🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭 Collector's Edition - 2.1% chance**: Vorpal is a solid tool to have here. This roll won't do the most single-target damage against bosses, but that's not why you have it; you have it for the utility it brings. Being able to slice through adds **and** throw a heavy attack at a Champion or Boss is 😙 C/o [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/), Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed stat you won't notice the difference.

Remember when we all thought Wish-Ender would break the Crucible because you could see through walls? That's the last time I thought bows might break the sandbox, or really even ever thought about using bows in PvP at all. Did you even know you can see through walls with Wish-Ender? I digress...

Many months ago, I saved a post by [/u/TheGuiltySpark117](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheGuiltySpark117) in the off chance I ever wanted to give bows a real shot in PvP. Over that time I've read and re-read it, every time I'm trying to figure out if I have a good bow roll. *I strongy suggest you check this out; it's phenomenal!*

[An In-Depth Guide to Using a Bow in Competitive PvP (Console or PC)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/hjvoka/an_indepth_guide_to_using_a_bow_in_competitive/)

I reached out to TheGuiltySpark117 who graciously wrote up thoughts and rolls for Whispering Slab. All of the content that follows is courtesy of TheGuiltySpark117. Plese head over to the [latest edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/fkgm0k/an_indepth_guide_to_using_a_bow_in_competitive/) of the guide and show your appreciation.

> I have two possible loadouts that I would consider a god roll for pvp. I don’t see a loadout for whispering slab that would be great for PvE, however.
### Whispering Slab - PvP
> You might’ve noticed that these aren’t specialized to the two types of playstyles I mention in my post. I did this on purpose because there are a much larger amount of players who aren’t bow mains, and care less about that kind of thing. These two are the best generalized god rolls that are tailored to the perspective of the majority. Both loadouts, however, are something that even I as a bow main in the crucible would be interested in acquiring.

    meaning you can pull it back and fire it faster. Aka, lowers ttk
    for the weapon by a small fraction. With this loadout we're not
    too concerned about accuracy as engagements will be at closer
    ranges.
  * `Fiberglass Arrow Shaft`: Lowers stability, which is not
    concerning for a bow, but increases accuracy considerably. This is
    the best type of arrow any bow can have because there are no
    noticeable drawbacks of having it.
  * `Killing Wind`: Adds five tiers of movement speed to your guardian
    when the trait is active, meaning you will feel much quicker and
    lighter, allowing you to play more aggressively.
  * `Unrelenting`: Rewards an aggressive playstyle by granting a small
    amount of health on top of triggering health regeneration. In the
    Crucible, every other guardian kill will trigger this trait.
    Triggering this trait means you'll have less downtime between
    engagements, and you'll have some room to perform interesting
    plays in 1v2/3 or more scenarios.
  * `Accuracy Masterwork`: This helps conteract the reduction in
    accuracy that Elastic string has, making the bow feel a little
    more reliable when shooting.

#### **GuiltySpark's Reserved Slab**
The objective of this loadout is to max it's Accuracy as high as it can go, so that the player can use it at longer distances and not feel forced to engage at closer ranges.

  * `High Tension String`: We're going for max accuracy with this
    loadout.
  * `Fiberglass Arrow Shaft`: Again, the best Arrow type for any bow.
  * `Archer's Tempo`: High Tension String gives an increase to draw
    speed, and Archer's Tempo will act to negate its effects while
    still lowering Draw Time to a reasonable degree.
  * `Opening Shot`: Further increases Accuracy and bullet magnetism to
    the head, making the bow more reliable at longer distances.
  * `Accuracy Masterwork`: Again, going for as high of an Accuracy
    stat as we can.

## Seventh Seraph Carbine - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph Carbine** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1561006927/seventh-seraph-carbine/)*


The Seventh Seraph Carbine (SSC) is a 450 RPM "Precision Frame" Kinetic Auto Rifle. Let's start with a quick comparison to randomly-rolled 450s, over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BdCxNP;mJ1-6;Bqp0Wx;Fju9i;DmTiv3). In general the 450s are fairly the same stat-wise, with a material deviation in Aim Assist for the SSC; easily addressable with an Aim Assist mod. 

Should you pick one up for use in Season 10? In Season 10, 600 RPM "Adaptive Frame" Auto Rifles are the meta (e.g. SUROS Regime, Monte Carlo, Hard Light). There's no pressing reason to chase SSC rolls for PvP.

I personally love ARs, so I played with a [zero-Recoil, high Stability](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/DY2Aqw8sOokyOvhv0Wv1Ehw9zBP2FwQRxW2Ig9KX1MIo3LEpW) roll for several Iron Banner games, with both Enhanced Targeting and Enhanced Unflinching. I immediately wanted to go back to using my Arc Logic with Moving Target and Tap the Trigger :) The SSC is definitely a bit slower than you'd prefer (as are all 450 RPMs, even the vaunted Uriel's Gift these days). 

That being said, if you enjoy Destiny's National Pasttime of shredding supers in sixes, a Vorpal-rolled SSC could be for you! If you're a fan of ARs or even just the SSC itself, why not pick one up and vault it just in case the meta changes? Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* The lower the RPM the higher the range, and falloff for a base range SSC starts ~30m which is quite far in-game; probably at the maximum range you'd choose to engage with an Auto Rifle anyway.
* I'm passing on `Threat Detector` because at that engagement range of 15m, you're going to feel like switching to your special weapon.
* With a base `Recoil` of `74`, you're fine there. I shot a few magazines into a wall with `100` and the pattern was the same. Do not put on a `Counterbalance` mod or else you'll ruin the recoil pattern. 
* I don't have any rolls featuring `Elemental Capacitor` because at some point you hit diminishing returns on all this `Stability`. I pivot around `Moving Target` because it's not something that many Auto Rifles can roll and it makes it far more lethal by directly addressing target acquisition.

Here's a few rolls worth considering that you can put to work today!
* **(PvP) Slif's "Pristine, Picture-Perfect Auto Rifle" 🧼📸 Collector's Edition - 0.0% chance**: This is my pristine, picture-perfect Auto Rifle roll. There's less than a 0.1% chance you get this, so if you do please buy us both a lottery ticket.

*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph Carbine** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1561006927/seventh-seraph-carbine/)*


For its base stats and perks, there isn't a whole lot of reason to consider the SSC for PvE. While it does feature Swashbuckler and Rampage, it doesn't combine it with a reload-boosting perk like Feeding Frenzy or Outlaw. Breakneck, the Gambit Pinnacle weapon with the unique perk `Onslaught` is also 450 RPM and recently received a buff in Season 10. It shreds in PvE and since it's a Legendary weapon, it can take the Season 10 Artifact mods.
Still, there's at least a couple of reasons why you might want to consider a SSC.
1. It's a Seraph weapon! If you're running Warmind mods on your armor, Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.
1. It can roll with `Fourth Time's the Charm` and `Vorpal` together, which activates on Champions and in the current Season 10, Auto Rifles can take Overload mods. In the future things will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier too. The mag seems endless when dumping in to Champions and bosses; kinda cool :)
* **(PvE) Slif's "Butter and Citrus Bar Shredder" 🧈🍊 - 2.8% chance**: This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE content. FTTC and Vorpal make the roll; without both you may as well use another Vorpal weapon. Based on the past two seasons, they won't be hard to come by :)

## Seventh Seraph CQC-12 - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph CQC-12** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1821724780/seventh-seraph-cqc-12/)*


The CQC-12 is an 80 RPM "Lightweight Frame" shotgun in the energy slot. Through leveling the season pass, you unlock a chance for it to drop at the conclusion of Gambit, Crucible and Strike activities. You can't really "farm" it per se. The good news is that there's only four perks in the final two columns meaning it's not incredibly difficult to get the perks you might be interested in. See how it compares to other randomly-rolled 80 RPMs over on  [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BslVBs;CEKlVP;Brud8B;DmKQYw). Statistically, they're all quite similar and like all shotguns, otherwise identical in barrels and magazines.

Three reasons why the CQC is exciting for PvP:

* Where the CQC-12 stands out from its kin is that it can roll with the vaunted Quickdraw + Snapshot pairing. No other 80 RPM shotgun can do this. Here's  [the list](https://www.light.gg/god-roll/?f=2,10\(Shotgun\),28:0\(706527188;957782887\)) of shotguns that can. Perhaps as a drawback however, it cannot roll with Opening Shot or Moving Target.
* It can roll with Vorpal which means it can two-shot any super in PvP. If you'd like a little footage of DFP slaying with Vorpal (and an otherwise) near perfect roll, [here you go](https://youtu.be/30b4t1XZdi0?t=110).
* It looks and sounds *amazing*, and that's like 80% of the reason to use a weapon :)

Our first couple of roll sets will be classic shotgun rolls and the third will feature Vorpal; currently the only shotgun that can roll it!

This section will be straightforward :) All of our rolls are toing to be centered around Trench Barrel. It provides a 50% damage boost vs. Vorpal's 15%. Trench Barrel takes a melee to activate, but with shotguns you have to be in melee range anyway, so you're good!

This isn't a "run and gun" shotgun. There are no damage-boosting perks, like Swashbuckler or Rampage, you have Slideshot and Auto-Loading Holster but so do plenty of other shotguns.
* **(PvE) Slif's "Butter and Citrus Bar Shredder" 🧈🍊Collector's Edition - 1.3% chance**: We're basing these next few rolls around Trench Barrel. Quickdraw will help with swapping from the hits between Trench Barrel activations.

## Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3037520408/seventh-seraph-officer-revolver/)*


The Officer Revolver is a 180 RPM Kinetic Hand Cannon. See how it compares to other 180 RPM Hand Cannons over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=C1DOIY;xtxS0;DzBRNi) Let's start off with Mercules and Kyt from the latest Massive Breakdown podcast. Turns out they [aren't super hot](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-156-seventh-seraph-weapons-breakdown#t=33:44) on the Officer's Revolver.

> **Mercules:** *"Noticably worse than every other Precision hand cannon except for Trust, which has better Aim Assist and Recoil then the Officer's. Statistically, Officer's is not a super impressive hand cannon."*

Personally I think that's overstating things. The Service Revolver isn't **that** much different in terms of base stats. Trust is clearly better but not insanely-so. That being said, it's a 180 and the 180s haven't been part of the PvP meta in quite a while. If they were any stonger they'd be three-tapping and that would make them far too strong. I agree with Mercules' position that given how easy they are to use, they have a balanced TTK.


Now let's check out [Drewsky's thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3kCNDYUnzM), who finds the novel perks like Firmly Planted and Timed Payload worth strong consideration. Notably, he had previously [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IevtKKR_YxM) wishing for more Hand Cannons to have Firmly Planted.
> **Drewsky:** *"I think this is actually a pretty competitive group of stats especially compared to a lot of the other 180 RPM hand cannons. What makes it special is that it has a group of pretty competitive stats; maybe not the best stats but maybe the best perk pool in combination with those stats available on a 180."*

Vorpal and Timed Payload are uniquely available on the Officer Revolver. I personally love Vorpal in PvP and love the idea of Timed Payload, but I've always liked variety more than than the objective, optimal meta. If that partially describes you and you're interested in bagging a few PvP rolls, read on!
> **Drewsky:** *"Prioritizing Range while giving the best oveall stat package possible."*

I only partially agree with Drewsky here. Going back to our understanding of the new compressed range on Hand Cannons, we can cite some science from CoolGuy: "(35 Range = 25m falloff, 86 Range = 28m)". I'm not sure I'd want to blow valuable Magazine and Barrel slots for one to three meters of falloff.

The good news is that the wishlist can support multiple perspectives! I'll put together a set of Range-prioritizing rolls representing Drewsky's perspective, and a set of Handling/Stability prioritizing rolls. There is no "baseline" roll for the Officer Revolver because the baseline stats aren't what make this weapon interesting. There are plenty of other 140s and 150s that you'd prioritize over this if you were just looking for a workhorse PvP Hand Cannon.
* **(PvP) Drewsky's "Planted Range" 🏔🌱🏔🌱🏔🌱Collector's Edition - 0.1% chance**: *"Timed Payload?! That's supposed to be positively horrible. Doesn't it lower your TTK?"* Well, it causes double the flinch and the explosion has no range falloff. On a 180 RPM Hand Cannon, Timed Payload shouldn't lower the TTK (Drewsky didn't have one on hand to verify the math) as you would be getting the kill on the last bullet and not on the last 17 damage from Timed Payload. Vorpal is great for shredding supers.

## Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3037520408/seventh-seraph-officer-revolver/)*


There are so many great Hand Cannons for general purpose add shredding that you can skip the Officer's Revolver if you don't feel like adding another one to your vault. Personally I had a perfectly rolled Service Revolver (Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip) and never used it because it couldn't one-tap red bar adds - a 140 or 150 with Kill Clip ends up being my preferred.

"OK Slif, so why do you even have a PvE section here?"
1. Most importantly, it's a Seraph weapon! If you're running Warmind mods on your armor, Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.
1. It can roll with Vorpal, which activates on Champions and in the current Season 10, Hand Cannons can take Overload and Unstoppable mods (and in the future will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier mods I'm sure).

"Whatevs, I've never been a fan of Vorpal and I don't really care about the seasonal stuff" - all good, stop reading and farm something else! It can also roll with Osmosis but with how great Hard Light and Borealis are, I can't imagine preparing for a difficult Strike or Nightmare Hunt and saying "Oh let me grab my Officer's Revolver with Osmosis to help us out!" 😉
* **(PvE) Slif's "Butter and Citrus Bar Shredder" 🧈🍊 - 2.8% chance**: This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE content. We don't need to be any more specific here; the other columns and Masterwork aren't deal-breakers or roll-makers. By itself, Vorpal isn't strong enough to recommend this over other Kinetics. **WARNING**: It's possible that a PvP roll without a preference in the FTTC column will "take" this roll. Bear in mind that might have this roll and it would be lit up as a PvP roll.

## Seventh Seraph SAW - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph SAW** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2582755344/seventh-seraph-saw/)*


Drewsky has a great review of the [Bane of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hqmrV1pk0), another 360 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Machine Gun. From the review, it hits for 48 crit / 38 body (TTK 0.5s / 0.83s). It's got terrific range and flinches like crazy.

That being said, it's still a Machine Gun which tends not to be the pick for PvP... BUT... BUT! The SAW can roll with `Opening Shot` in the final column. Because the rate of fire is so low, you can single tap out shots and get crits across the map. Try out some Machine Gun sniping in Mayhem and let me know how that works out for you 🎯

Otherwise, there's no pressing reason to farm for a SAW for PvP, at least none moreso than any other Machine Gun.
* **(PvP) Slif's "Sniper MG" 🎯 Collector's Edition - 0.5% chance**: Any basic roll will chew up Guardians with a lot of flinch. Let's add `Range` and `Stability` where we can, while seeing what `Opening Shot` can do.

## Seventh Seraph SAW - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph SAW** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2582755344/seventh-seraph-saw/)*


The SAW is 360 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Machine Gun and is an absolute monster in PvE. *"But Slif, everyone says Machine Guns are crap for DPS so why do you even have a PvE section?!?"*

Walk with me, grasshopper.

This is going to be a long one because I haven't found any super detailed coverage of the SAW (or any other Seraph weapon save for the Hand Cannon). Fortunately since a High-Impact is a High-Impact (at base), Drewsky has a great review of the [Bane of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hqmrV1pk0) that's definitely worth watching! The SAW can't roll with most of the perks he discussed in that video, but it's still super solid at its base.

* It's a Seraph weapon which means it generates Warmind Cells if you have Warmind mods equipped (Season 10).
* As a High-Impact Frame, the SAW keeps anything it doesn't kill practically stun-locked. As the difficulty of PvE content increases, this becomes super important. Even if you're not doing Grandmaster Nightfalls, flinching challenging adds sure makes things more straightforward. Keeping the bosses flinched as they march towards your plate during a Seraph Tower event comes in handy!
* Its base effecive `Range` is amazing. Damage falloff starts ~45m and is reasonable up to ~50m (-5%). You're talking maximum damage at Scout Rifle ranges. At maximum range, the sight overlaps your target because MGs don't have high-zoom sights/scopes. *This is why I'm not suggesting any `Range` boosting below - when I pushed the `Range` to `93` falloff and floors were unchanged and the recoil/handling will make it challenging to stay on target anyway.*
* It's the only Machine Gun that can roll with `Vorpal` or `Firing Line` in the final column, which provide 15% and 25% damage boosts, respectively. Those are substantial increases to damage without requiring a kill or reload to activate. 

If you're still not bought in, that's cool 😀👋. If you're still here, let's get those rolls! In order of importance:

* Column 3:
  * ✅`Field Prep` is far and away the winner. It grants a whopping 25%
  more in reserve (223 to 278), speeds up your reload time by two seconds
  (~5.5s to ~3.5s) and increases ready and stow speed. For PvE, nothing
  else comes close. By the way, within 45m at 1,222 to 1,716 damage,
  that's an extra 67k - 94k damage available to you.

  * ❌`Auto-Loading Holster` and `Grave Robber` are the other two reload
  perks in this column and neither is worth giving up the reserve and
  handling bonuses that `Field Prep` provides.

* Column 4:
  * ✅`Firing Line`: 25% damage boost when near two teammates. In
PvE content you're nearly always with your fireteam: Strikes, Raids, Menagerie, Vex Offensive, Sundial, Seraph Towers... I'm comfortable reccomending `Firing Line` in general. It has double utility in dealing with adds and on boss DPS. Granted it's not your go-to for boss damage but since you already have it equipped for adds and Champions, may as well have something to do with all this ammo when you're on the boss!

  * ✅`Vorpal`: 15% damage boost to yellow bars and Champions. It's
a solid pick if you don't have one with `Firing Line`.

  * ❌`Mulligan`: Nope. You shouldn't be missing many shots and the
opportunity cost of Mulligan is too high. At maximum range on the Tribute Hall Ogre, I was hitting at least 50% crits at the base `Recoil` and no `Stability` boosts.

  * ❌`Opening Shot`: This is interesting because at 360 RPM you can tap
out one bullet at a time, turning this in to kind of an incredibly high-impact Scout Rifle. Situationally cool but you can still use the SAW like this just fine without it. Arguably more of an off-meta PvP pick.

  * ❌`Elemental Capacitor`: While large, the effect of any of these
increases pales in comparison to significantly higher damage output. You can also get each of the benefits through other perks or armor mods. This isn't a case in general against `Capacitor`, just on this particular weapon.

  * ❌`Disruption Break`: A 50% Kinetic damage bonus debuff is nothing to
sneeze at! This is a niche pick for when you're up against Arc shields because in a Match Game activity, you won't do enough damage to break non-matching shields. Myself, if I'm hopping in to a difficult PvE activity I'm going to get more general, always-on use from Firing Line.
Otherwise we're shooing for higher Stability
* **(PvE) Slif's "Together Forever" 🤝♬ Collector's Edition - 0.6% chance**: With other Guardians at your side, you will rip through hordes of aliens no problem. We're taking any Barrel that increases Stability and magazine-extended... Magazines. Extended Magazine would normally be a hot mess with a base `Reload` so low, but with Field Prep it only takes the reload from ~3.5s to ~4.5s (still 1s shorter than the base `Reload`).

## Seventh Seraph SI-2
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph SI-2** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3937866388/seventh-seraph-si-2/)*

The SI-2 is the 2020 version of the Anonymous Autumn (Kyt: *"which is the best-in-class for lightweight sidearms"*) and is the only other randomly rolled 360 RPM Energy sidearm. Mercules is on the same page: *"It (SI-2) doesn't have great Stability or great Range. I would pick a well-rolled Anonymous Autumn over this every time."* Why do they say that? It's got basically the same stats as an Anonymous Autumn but has 33% less Range and 20% less Stability. On the plus side the SI-2 has 7% better Handling (64 > 69) 🙃
### Seventh Seraph SI-2 - PvP
TrueVanguard, who absolutely loves the Anonymous Autumn (with over 14,000 kills) depicts the SI-2 as situational, relying primarily on Vorpal to justify using it. Check out [his thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCtP2PjAEgY).

If you are going to consider the SI-2 for PvP, a few things to keep in mind:
* The recoil direction is 95, so no need to worry about straightening it out. I.e. the +Recoil barrels shouldn't be your first pick. Instead, focus on Range and Stability.
* Full Auto is going to be a make-or-break perk for some, as many guardians have a love-it-or-hate-it relationsihp with single-shot sidearms. If that's your thing, know that no other perk in that column is a must-have. I find that 360s are unsuable for me without it, so I'll be picking one of these up to see how it plays with Vorpal.
#### **Full Auto Super Shredder**
These rolls aren't super tight on the Barrel and Magazine front because they aren't going to dramatically alter the value of the overall roll. Vorpal is really the key here. Without Vorpal, you're better off using the better-rolled Anonymous Autumn as mentioned above. Otherwise we're going for +Range and +Stability wherever we can get it.

Like all other Seraph weapons, the SI-2 contributes to the generation of Warmind cells in PvE. If that's not your thing, you can pretty much pass on this weapon full stop. Since it can roll with Dragonfly, it could have made beautiful music with the `Wrath of Rasputin` Warmind mod: `Solar splash damage final blows have a chance to create Warmind Cells`. Unfortunately the SI-2 is a Void weapon 👿

That being said, there are a few combos that could prove interesting for the discerning collector / sidearm aficionado.
#### **Sparks Flying**
The SI-2 is the only sidearm in the game that can roll with both Demolitionist and Dragonfly. That's exciting because Demolitionist counts the Dragonfly collateral kills towards getting your grenade back. Don't forget the `Dragonfly Spec` mod from Ada-1!

## Seventh Seraph VY-7 - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph VY-7** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/766323545/seventh-seraph-vy-7/)*


The VY-7 is a 600 RPM Energy "Precision Frame" SMG. Here's how it compares to all other randomly-rolled 600 RPM SMGs on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=trStZ;CYr9QP;CQZu7f;B9hF8b;). It's competitive base-stat-wise but there's a reason you've probably never been killed by any of these weapons (or any SMG for that matter) since the first year of Destiny 2. In Season 10 with the recent Adaptive Auto Rifle buff, Auto Rifles outclass SMGs and failing ARs, both sidearms and shotguns are going to frustrate the hell out of you.

Forget it right? But do you remember this world?

* [Antiope-D's FINAL FORM! (God Roll)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxnkTvtuXEA) - Destiny Fun Police
* [The Perfect Antiope-D does exist!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3tC-IkkFRU) - CammyCakes
* [Antiope-D and Sniping = New Meta ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjG32gyUh_w) - ZkMushroom

The VY-7 is an Energy Antiope-D (the basic stat variances are immaterial in practice). Yes it's not the meta now, but a solid roll might be worth throwing in the vault.

"Why don't any of these rolls value `Range`?" The difference between the base range of `59` and let's say `80` (using Accurized Rounds, etc.) buys you about a whopping one meter of falloff (~16 to ~17m). I don't value buffing Range all that highly on the VY-7. It's not that it's *bad* per se, it's just that the opportunity cost is high.
* **(PvP) Slif's "Weird Auto Rifle but OK" 🤷‍♂️🌱 Collector's Edition - 0.7% chance**: We're going to use a Counterbalance Mod to get the Recoil to 100, so we can go for Stability-enhancing Barrel options. Wait, what the hell is `Elemental Capacitor` doing in there?! The Handling and Stability bonuses are material. The Stability bonus is the most noticeable,  [estimated](https://youtu.be/D_Mv-AdfYqM?t=36) to be around `20 points`. You *absolutely* feel the difference with `Elemental Capacitor` active (don't forget to swap weapons if you're testing it) so I won't be relaxing it on these rolls. I think there's not much of a point to this SMG above other Energy weapons unless you can flex what makes it unique, and `Elemental Capacitor` certainly does that.

## Seventh Seraph VY-7 - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph VY-7** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/766323545/seventh-seraph-vy-7/)*


The VY-7 is the only SMG that's able to roll with Vorpal and you'll want one of these for two reasons:

* The VY-7 is a Seraph weapon and contributes to the generation of Warmind Cells.
* SMGs are eligible for certain Season 10 Artifact weapon mods.

...so let's come up with some rolls that help shred Champions and generate Warmind Cells (i.e. shred adds).

You must absolutely run a `Counterbalance` Mod or otherwise fix the Recoil with `Arrowhead Brake` or `Chambered Compensator`. Even though its base Recoil is `91` it's still a hot mess to control, esp. with its low Handling. For the rolls below I'm going to assume you're rolling with a `Counterbalance` Mod installed.
* **(PvE) "Champion Shredder" 🏆💥 Collector's Edition - 0.7% chance**: Whenever SMGs are up on the Artifact, you'll want Vorpal to help shred through Champions. FTTC might seem like a strange choice for an SMG but the rate of fire is so fast, you'd be surprised how often it you end up getting it to proc. I won't be relaxing either Vorpal or FTTC on these rolls because just one of either would mean that it's not worth using this over something else in the Energy slot.

CoolGuy's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) is both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP. Some choice cuts: "I would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to Vorpal." "Landing shots is more important than accuracy; shouldn't be worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to agree - Vorpal is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times. Without Vorpal, it's just another two-burst sidearm. You may as well use a Smuggler's Word with Tap the Trigger, which has one of the lowest TTKs in all of Destiny.
* **(PvP) Slif's Picky Super Killer 💥 - 0.2% chance**: This is my personal perfect PVP roll. Threat Detector has a far longer range than you'd think (beyond damage falloff) and Vorpal shreds through supers. The rest of this roll is all about maxing out the range.

*For all possible perks, check out **Breachlight** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1289997971/breachlight/)*


Ehroar focuses on Breachlight - ["This Sidearm Might Just Be The New Recluse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY) "I truly believe this weapon is better than Recluse and I believe it will be the new meta for PvE." He mentions three amazing rolls (well four kinda) that I'll capture below. You won't see obviously good rolls here (e.g. Outlaw + MKC) because the combination is so straightforward and easy to roll. I.e. you don't need to come to a DIM wishlist to tell you that these perks pair well togther :)
* **(PvE) Picky Gunslinger - 3.0% chance**: Ehroar: "Great for basic add clear. Once you get MKC going you can shred Majors and Ultras." We're going for max range with some extra perks and a Masterwork, but those are just icing on this shredding cake. The lack of a Range Masterwork, or any specific Masterwork doesn't make or break this roll so I'm leaving it out.

* **(PvE) Picky Never-Reloader - 5.4% chance**: Once you get on a tear, the damage perks will recharge your grenade quickly and by throwing it, you'll reload the mag. Rinse and repeat. This is especially spicy when paired with Devour-lock.

*For all possible perks, check out **Gallant Charge** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1706206669/gallant-charge/)*


Fallout has an interesting, [pro-Stability take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4) on the Gallant. "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players". It's bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I prefer the unaltered charge time. There's not too many rolls here because it's not really worth running unless you get enough stat differentiation to make it more valuable than your dozens of alternatives in this crowded Energy slot.
* **(PvP) Fallout Stabile Zapper Collector's Edition ✨ - 1.3% chance**: Bringing all of our stability and range tools to bear here. We want to first "fix" the recoil by getting it as close to ending in a `5` as we can. Then we go for Stability!

## Gallant Charge - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Gallant Charge** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1706206669/gallant-charge/)*


CoolGuy has a [terrific PvE review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) of the Gallant. It has a PvP perspective but that part isn't as strong as Fallout's (IMHO, on this particular weapon). The important perks are your third and fourth column for these rolls, so really any of them are fine.

## Infinite Paths 8 - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Infinite Paths 8** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3233390913/infinite-paths-8/)*


CoolGuy reviews IP8 for both PvP and PvE, which is where these rolls originate. He discusses the State of the Union with respect to these frames [timestamped here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE&t=1023) and it makes for super interesting listening. TL;DR - Of all the Pulse Rifle frames, the lightweights require you to be the most precise yet reward you with the second slowest TTK. They're the only ones he feels are not currently competitive. Given that they used to be the best frames in D1 (remember Hawksaw?), file one away for a future date.
* **(PvP) "CoolGuy's Middle Child" Collector's Edition - 0.0% chance**: In the video above, CoolGuy makes a strong case for some buffs to this "middle" archetype of Pulse Rifle. "On console, Zen Moment and Eye of the Storm are great but you're going to get more utility from Zen Moment." We'll add EotS in later as a fallback.

## Infinite Paths 8 - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Infinite Paths 8** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3233390913/infinite-paths-8/)*


Here we're featuring a few rolls from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE) mentioned above. I would put these pretty low on my list but if you're a fan of the aesthetic of the Osiris weapons, why not grab a few of these while they're still available? "It performs as expected. Great for mid- and low-tier adds. It does really well."

These rolls are just north of 2% because of the number of perks in the final two columns `(0.16 * 0.16 = 0.02)`, and the fact that they don't benefit from the Season 9 Rank 92 bonus of an additional perk in the final column.
* **(PvE) Explosive Dragon 🐉 - 2.2% chance**: This is the one of the few weapons in the game that can roll with Demolitionist + Dragonfly. Each enemy that dies to Dragonfly (don't forget Dragonfly Spec!) will count as an additional kill for Demolitionist.

  ```
  Barrels [100%]: *
  Mags    [ 78%]: Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Drop Mag, Alloy Magazine
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Demolitionist
  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Dragonfly

* **(PvE) Punchy 👊 - 2.2% chance**: Classic punching. Not sure why you'd be punching enemies with your Pulse Rifle equipped but I'm not the boss of you. 👊PUNCH AWAY!👊

## Jack Queen King 3 - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Jack Queen King 3** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/410996590/jack-queen-king-3/)*


This is going to blow your mind... but JQK3 and Waking Vigil (via Dreaming City) are the only two randomly rolled 150 RPM Hand Cannons and the only other Energy HCs apart from Luna's Howl (RIP Luna) and Not Forgotten. Its base stats are [among the best of all of these](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=JLYoE;JLYoH;T6w4n;Yf09u) with `96` AA (91+Sight) and `73` Handling! For analysis and gameplay, check out this [CammyCakes review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHIhi5fkxDw). One interesting bit that stood out: "The diffence between a max range JKQ3 and medium range one is about half a meter". Yes for falloff that's true, but since Range affects stickyness, it's still got value here. For some of us (myself included), [CoolGuy's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI5CjuOonRc) on the JKQ3 might be more up your alley, PvP-wise: "For Crucible it isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s kind of an acquired taste." It's never clicked with me but some people absolutely love it. IMHO similar to Sunshot - it's great on paper but the model is so chunky that it obscures where you're aiming when it kicks up. Its stiff competition and model/kick funkyness are why these rolls are so narrow. It needs a lot to compete with Luna's, Not Forgotten and Waking Vigil (which can be farmed from Menagerie with a predetermined Masterwork). The second set of these rolls is meant to be slightly more forgiving if you really want Demo and/or Snapshot.
* **(PvP) Incredibly, Hilariously Picky - 0.1% chance**: Be sure to let me know how many dieties you prayed to in order to get  this roll. I'd suggest also buying a lottery ticket post-haste. As much Stability and Handling as we can get.

  ```
  Barrels [ 33%]: Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    [ 25%]: Ricochet Rounds
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Demolitionist
  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Snapshot
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Stability MW
  ```
* **(PvP) Incredibly, Hilariously Picky (Sans Demo) - 0.3% chance**: The first thing we're going to do is remove Demo from the list of required perks. The roll is top-tier without it.

  ```

  Mags    [ 46%]: Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell

  MWorks  [ 25%]: Stability MW

[Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVXNkbyfBrQ): "I definitely think this will be one of the best hand cannons in PvE and probably PvP in the energy slot." In general we're sticking with Rampage so we can throw on Rampage Spec and ride it out. Sure Swashbuckler and  Surrounded + Surrounded Spec are awesome but it's a Hand Cannon and you're probably not punching enemies if you're trying to work in its effective range. Those perks work better on sidearms, SMGs and shotguns. CoolGuy has a [great set of rolls](https://youtu.be/XI5CjuOonRc?t=463) I'm incorporating here as well. "Very stout PvE hand cannon; top-tier."
* **(PvE) Sparks Flying (Super Picky) - 2.0% chance**: Both Demolitionist and Subistence will proc once for each Dragonfly explosion kill. Use in situations where you can one-shot enemies. Don't forget Dragonfly Spec! Per CoolGuy, this is a rarely available combo; pick it up.

  ```
  Barrels [ 93%]: Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS
  Mags    [ 78%]: High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Light Mag

  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Dragonfly
  MWorks  [ 50%]: Stability MW, Handling MW
  ```
* **(PvE) Sparks Flying (Sans Masterworks) - 4.1% chance**: Same as the above with relaxed masterworks. Neither good nor bad enough to tank or make the roll.

  ```

  ```
* **(PvE) The Never-Ending Reloader (Super Picky) - 2.0% chance**: You'll almost never have to reload here, because getting kills with the sustained DPS perks will give you your grenade back and using your grenade will reload the magazine.

  ```
  Barrels [ 93%]: Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS

Datto posted some in-depth comparisons between LitS and other DPS weapons [earlier in Season 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzDK0NWMgM). As we approach the final third of Season 9, it's still not a great DPS choice, but it "can compete with the likes of Sole Survivor" but who knows what will happen in the future? Since it's so easy to farm and S92 gives you an extra perk in the final slot, why not hang on to these?
* **(PvE) Super Picky DPS - 0.3% chance**: The full suite of perks to maximize DPS on a big ol' target. We're looking for some Stability-enhancing barrels as well.

## Martyr's Retribution - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Martyr's Retribution** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3850168899/martyrs-retribution/)*


I absolutely love this new "Wave Frame" (i.e. Thermite Jr.) archetype! Our roll choices below might seem a little odd, but here we go. For PvP I want this always ready, loaded and moving quickly. That means I'm looking for Reload and Velocity in that order. The base Velocity @ `86` and Reload @ `77` (thanks to `High-Velocity Rounds` being one of two fixed barrels) seems more than good enough, so lets focus on Reload and Handling. I don't require Demolitionist because like Fighting Lion, I see Martyr's more as a starter than a finisher. By all means, roll with it, but I'm more excited about the perks below because I think we'll get more consistent utility from them. With breach-load launchers, we're going to run `Quick Access Sling`, which buffs swapping speed and since the Martyr's Handling stat is already so high, I don't think we need too much more Handling here. Let's look for Velocity-based barrels and since there's only two available magazines, that choice is easy ;)
* **(PvP) Super Picky - 1.5% chance**: Elemental Capacitor's +Reload and +Handling buffs (Solar and Arc respectively) are pheneomenal attributes to bump on breach load launchers.

This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go.
* **(PvE) Shieldbreaker - 5.3% chance**: Martyr's absolutely shreds shields and a shieldsplosion roll like this will be super fun. Those hopefully chained kills should keep your grenade rolling from Demolitionist and upon activating it will reload your weapon and so on...

CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI). Since this is a controller wishlist, these rolls are all about maxing Stability. All of these PvP rolls would be perfectly fine rolls in PvE as well.
* **(PvP/PvE) "Rapid Hitstability" - 1.6% chance**: This is all about stability. Yes, Explosive Rounds and Vorpal don't increase stability but they would make this already great roll even better.

* **(PvP/PvE) Rapid Rangestability - 1.4% chance**: Maybe even though you're on controller, you like your Stability with a side of Range? Listen, I'm not the boss of you. Range barrels are a great option with this roll as well, but I think, less desirable hence their place in the batting order.

## Perfect Paradox - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Perfect Paradox** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3393519051/perfect-paradox/)*


Rapid-fire frames in PvP are a different breed. They're not like Aggressive or Precision Frames for the spicy, consistent one-hit kills. If you want something like that in this slot, you want to farm Menagerie for [Dust Rock Blues](https://www.light.gg/db/items/636912560/dust-rock-blues/) or even [Toil and Trouble](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2957367743/toil-and-trouble/).

The big debate here will be Opening Shot or Rampage. Many folks, like Sheikh (aka [Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njEmXDccobw)) prefer Rampage + Rampage Spec in the final slot. I don't and here's why:

1. Rapid-fire frames require 12 pellets to kill. Each tier of Rampage decreases the number of pellets needed by one. Here's DFP going on a [killing spree](https://youtu.be/OSTDpEo7_D4?t=187) with Rampage x 2, the tier where you need 10 pellets to kill (i.e. a Dust Rock Blues pellet count). If you're going to two-tap basically no matter what, I'd rather have Opening Shot to increase the chance more of my pellets hit. Even DFP says, "Using a Rapid-Fire shotgun you're going to have to double-tap most people."
2. I prefer to use Icarus Grip in my mod slot. That doesn't negate the power of Rampage in general but if you're not going to run Rampage Spec, that's even less of a reason to consider running Rampage.

Based on the YouTube content creator hive mind, I'm in the minority on this opinion. It's easy to farm; be your own judge :)
* **(PvP) Aztecross Collector's Edition 🌶 - 0.2% chance**: Alright, here's a spicy take. Firmly Planted works while sliding and increases Accuracy **specifically**, not indirectly via Range. We discussed Opening Shot above and how I value hitting more pellets all the time versus doing a negligible additional amount of damage when Rampage is active, some of the time. This is the first roll that [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ) uses in his video review (among others). It cleans up!

There's a good bit of [cargo-culting](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cargo_culting) when it comes to shotgun "God Rolls" and while I don't think there's any outright awful damage perks here, I do think you're better off with some than with others. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ) is a good balance of science and excitement in terms of roll knowledge, so check it out; he's one of the rare folks to see the value in the criminally underrated Firmly Planted on shotguns.

There are a ton of damage-boosting perks on Perfect Paradox! We have Swashbuckler, One-Two Punch, Trench Barrel and Rampage. Let's go!
* **One-Two Punch**: If you're going to be using One-Two, you're better off with a high(er) impact shotgun. Your flow is shoot-punch-punch-shoot-... and with a Rapid Fire frame, your "shoot" is doing very little damage, comparatively. The perk is solid, but not on this frame IMHO.
* **Trench Barrel**: Post-Warmind, Trench Barrel took it on the chin. It was limited to a few seconds or three shots. Given that Bungie has never gone back on a nerf, feel free to pick one of these up for posterity but it's not all that great. It's kind of like the reverse One-Two Punch. Your flow is punch-shoot-shoot-shoot-punch-... so it's better for large(r) add clear but if you're dealing with larger adds/bosses you're getting stomped away so yeah, it's fine but not anyone's go-to at the moment.
* **Rampage**: Solid! Not much to say here; same as it ever was. Throw a Rampage Spec mod on to extend the duration by 1s.
* **Swashbuckler**: I prefer Swashbuckler here because it lasts as long as Rampage + Rampage Spec and you can shortcut the with a melee to Swash x 5.

BONUS! From Ehroar, a pretty slick [Infinite Ammo Perfect Paradox Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlqw1OEGVl0)!
* **(PvE) Super Picky Demolitionist 💣 - 1.7% chance**: With an extra one in the mag from Appended and Demolitionist, you're going to be constantly reloading your magazine.

## Steelfeather Repeater - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Steelfeather Repeater** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1251729046/steelfeather-repeater/)*


CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out, we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689) for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvP) Super Picky Straight-Up Recoil - 0.3% chance**: We're looking to max Stability and Range after maxing recoil. The roll is built around `Arrowhead Brake` and `Firmly Planted`. Other sources of stability are gravy.

  ```

  ```
* **(PvP) Super Picky Max Range - 1.3% chance**: Most of our stability will come from Firmly Planted so lets use the barrels and magazines to push out the range.

  ```
  Barrels [ 83%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel, Full Bore, Corkscrew Rifling
  Mags    [ 78%]: High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Light Mag

*For all possible perks, check out **Steelfeather Repeater** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1251729046/steelfeather-repeater/)*


There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4) has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."
* **(PvE) Super Picky - 10.1% chance**: How can we keep DPS up as long as possible while preserving as much Range and Stability as possible?

  ```

CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)! There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can roll with Disruption Break which works in PvP (?!) as well as a combo of Rapid Hit and Tap the Trigger, which is a rare combo.  Keep in mind TJ5 doesn't benefit from from the Season 9 R92 additional perk in the last slot, so these rolls are *tough* to get. Recently, True Vanguard [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QXBw6NFi08) and that reminded me to get a little more specific on the picky rolls.
* **(PvP) "Perfectly Balanced, As All Things Should Be" 🦹‍♂️ - 0.4% chance**: With an `84` base Stability and two Stability perks in the third and fourth columns, let's focus on increasing Range (not at the cost of Stability).

  ```
  Barrels [ 93%]: Quickdot SAS, Control SAS, Tactic SAS, Shortspec SAS
  Mags    [ 64%]: High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Rapid Hit
  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Tap the Trigger
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Range MW
  ```
* **(PvP) "Perfectly Balanced" (Relaxed Magazines) 🦹‍♂️ - 0.6% chance**: Same as the above, minus the magazines. These magazines add very little Range, so we're not missing out on much.

*For all possible perks, check out **Traveler's Judgement 5** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4149758318/travelers-judgment-5/)*


These rolls are pulled from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4) above. Disruption Break, who knew? CoolGuy makes a great point: we might see a "season of the sidearm" where artifact perks like Barrier can be applied to sidearms and since Barrier is a shield, Disruption Break will be great to pair with it. If you don't use Disruption Break, you're better off using another Energy weapon with damage-increasing perks.
* **(PvE) Super Picky Shieldbreaker - 0.4% chance**: That could mean breaking Barriers with Disruption Break, and not many weapons can roll with that perk! We're adding ALH because to use Disruption Break you need to switch to your Kinetic weapon, which means ALH will proc and TJ5 will be reloaded and ready to go.

More of a PvE sniper, so we aren't going to have much to lay down here for a great roll. If you're hungry for a PvP Energy sniper, you want the  Beloved (Menagerie), Apostate (Altar of Sorrows) or Twilight Oath (Dreaming City). CoolGuy: ["It's OK, nothing special."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) Handling additions are appreciated because it's such a clunky weapon. I toyed with not even having rolls here but it's easy to farm and only here this season; why not grab a decent roll?
* **(PvP) "Snipe Like a Psion!" 🐲 - 0.8% chance**: Psions use Trophy Hunter - who knew? "Pulse Monitor"?! Yeah, there's only four perks in the third column and it's the only one applicable to PvP. The is the only randomly-rolled sniper in the game with Pulse Monitor. Everythig else is attempting to buff the Handling so it doesn't feel so sluggish.

  Barrels [ 58%]: Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel

* **(PvP) "Snipe Like a Psion!" (Relaxed Pulse) 🐲 - 3.1% chance**: Same as the above, minus `Pulse Monitor` which really is not a big deal in the first place, but neat to have if you're burning through Fractaline for these rolls.

CoolGuy: ["One of the best solo snipers in the game."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI) "Solo" also means "playing solo with a random group" (i.e. not coordinated). Nearly a perfect sniper for Gambit, especially paired with Malfeasance. You'll note these rolls are pretty strict, and that's because there are so few perks in the final two columns. Handling is so, so low on this sniper that I think you absolutely want the +20-25 Handling from a combo of the barrel perk and Masterwork.
* **(PvE) "Triple Tap Your Way to Seven" - 0.8% chance**: That's a quote from CoolGuy's review :) Throw a `Backup Mag` mod on here to be able to do that.

* **(PvE) Gambit Shieldbreaker - 1.4% chance**: Yep it works great outside of Gambit, but even better within. Pair it with Malfeasance. Shoot shields, break them and it refills the mag. Then switch to Malfeasance (Kinetic with bonus Taken damage) and MELT.
