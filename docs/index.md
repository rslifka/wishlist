# Chroma Rush
*For all possible perks, check out **Chroma Rush** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/1119734784)*

Chroma Rush is one of the many beautiful new weapons available in S14. It's a 720 RPM Rapid-Fire Frame Auto Rifle; the only available in the game apart from Arctic Haze. See how they compare [over on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BCvcwA;BP3N0;). Artic Haze suffered from a punishing base recoil and a lack of stability and damage-dealing perks whereas Chroma has both of those in spades.
### Chroma Rush / PvP / Overview
AR's were most recently meta a few seasons back when the 600 RPM variant dominated the Crucible. They've since been tuned a bit and haven't seen much play since the dawn of 120 RPM Hand Cannons. 720s are a bit more interesting since presumably a faster rate of fire means more flinch, and flinch is how ARs win gunfights against their slower, more stable-shooting brethren.

* As a 720 RPM Auto, Chroma's base Aim Assist and Stability are very good. I'd like to avoid spending the core slots on perks that provide incremental benefits to those very good stats, like `Dynamic Sway Reduction` or `Tap the Trigger`. These perks buff already strong core attributes. **Don't get me wrong; they're phenomenal perks, but you already knew that.**
* I'm also avoiding an emphasis on `Range`. If you spend every column on maximizing `Range`, you're adding a whopping 3m of falloff at the cost of otherwise S-tier perks.
* Its base Recoil is 45 and I've made great use of several rolls that have no `Recoil`-adjusting Barrels.

All of that being said, nearly **every perk** in the final two columns is terrific. E.g. `Thresh` is great, but I'm not calling it out here because you don't need a wishlist to tell you it's a good perk (i.e. it needs to harmonize with another perk or combo of perks on the weapon to warrant being part of a roll.)
### Chroma Rush / PvP / Roll / **"Catching Fire"**
With `Heating Up` and `Kill Clip` going, Chroma Rush feels like a longer-range [Recluse](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3354242550/the-recluse/). `Kill Clip` takes you from an optimal TTK of `9h1b/0.77s` to `6h2b/0.60s` and your body shot TTK from `1.17s` to `0.83s`. `Heating Up` seems practically designed for Auto Rifles, buffing your Accuracy, Stability and Recoil 🤯 "But Slif, `Heating Up` will go to waste while I'm reloading to proc Kill Clip". The reload is snappy; you'll have time. Throw on some some Auto Rifle reload mods if you're concerned.
```
  Barrels [ 22%]: Smallbore
  Mags    [ 28%]: Steady Rounds
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Heating Up

### Chroma Rush / PvP / Roll / **"Color Wheel"**
This is similar to the above roll, swapping out `Heating Up` in exchange for `Tunnel Vision`, which perhaps more synergistically procs on reload along with `Kill Clip`.

### Chroma Rush / PvE / Overview
I absolutely love 720 RPM Autos in PvE; perhaps my favourite weapon type across all of Destiny. I was sad to see my beloved [Steelfeather Repeater](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1251729046/steelfeather-repeater/) be sunset but c'est la vie. Of the new perks on Chroma Rush (`Heating Up`, `Tunnel Vision` and `Adrenaline Junkie`), only `Adrenaline Junkie` is compelling in PvE. It does work, but only in niche situations where you can keep your grenades up. Sure there are builds that can do that, but you don't need this wishlist to tell you that you're looking for a single perk.

Here we're going with old reliable combos. `Subsistence` was recently buffed to ease off the penalty to your reserves, and is an absolute S-tier perk now.
### Chroma Rush / PvE / Roll / **"Still Life"**
Both `Subsistence` and `Rampage` form the core of this roll.
```
  Barrels [ 22%]: Hammer-Forged Rifling
  Mags    [ 28%]: Accurized Rounds
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Subsistence
  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Rampage
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Range MW

# Gridskipper
*For all possible perks, check out **Gridskipper** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/1621558458)*

Gridskipper is a 540RPM Rapid-Fire Pulse Rifle introduced in Season 14. It's the only 540 RPM Energy Pulse Rifle available at the moment and drops with all of the new seasonal perks. Definitely pick this up if you frequent the Crucible.
### Gridskipper / PvP / Overview
Gridskipper is a phenomenal PvP weapon and arguably the best weapon introduced in S14. Many folks have reviewed it; here are a handful of selections:
> *The feel of this gun is so very Destiny... and so terribly well-balanced and is yet another reminder that Bungie is the best at fun gameplay, bar none.* - [Ascendant Nomad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya5a-uIbq7w)

> *This is the best pulse rifle in the game. Better than Messenger, 100%. Time to do the new activity to get the god roll!* - [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M8xjUzDRfU)

> *This thing is an absolute laser beam. Terrific Aim Assist and a vertical recoil pattern. It ticks all the boxes for me.* -  [DFP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y5XZrTjSxs)

**Why no Frenzy?** Frenzy has steep activation requirements and has an immaterial impact on your TTKs.

**Why so much Multikill Clip?** At x1, MKC drops your TTK from `7c2b/0.80s` to `7c0b/0.67s` and your body shot TTK from `1.40s` to a much more palatable `1.13s`.
### Gridskipper / PvP / Roll / **"Heat Dome"**
The two new third-column perks `Heating Up` and `Tunnel Vision` are brilliant on the Gridskipper. I'm partial to `Heating Up` but people love them both. The roll wouldn't otherwise be different so I'm combining them here
```
  Barrels [ 22%]: Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    [ 25%]: Ricochet Rounds
  Perks 1 [ 33%]: Heating Up, Tunnel Vision
  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Multikill Clip
  MWorks  [ 25%]: Stability MW

### Gridskipper / PvP / Roll / **"The All-Around'er"**
Capturing all of the best perks in the final two columns. Any combination here will be a terrific PvP weapon.
```
  Barrels [ 22%]: Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    [ 25%]: Ricochet Rounds

On Pulse Rifles, `Firmly Planted` is an acquired taste. I loved it on my Jian 7 paired with `Rangefinder`; amazing laser beam on long(er) sight lines.

# Ignition Code
*For all possible perks, check out **Ignition Code** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/304659313)*

> *The most important weapon to get this season that will be relevant in the PvE meta for some time"* - [Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk53lvImHRU)

> *This thing is horrifying. It's going to remind you of The Mountaintop It's like a full-auto GL!* - [Frostbolt](https://youtu.be/jJFV_4Y6p7s)

Well, I'm not sure the world of players will get as much utility out of this in PvP as Frostbolt does, but you will definitely make magic with it inside of PvE. If there's one Splicer weapon you farm for this season, make it the Ignition Code.
### Ignition Code / PvP / Overview
There seems to be a new PvP meta emerging / has emerged using GLs to "prime" (i.e. do a material amount of damage to you) and then finish you off with a high-impact/low-RoF primary. It's been the case for a couple of seasons by now, but I'm seeing it more now that Ignition Code is so easy to get.
### Ignition Code / PvP / Roll / **"Avalanche"**
You'll notice that we're looking to lower `Blast Radius` to ensure that we concentrate as much of the damage as possible on to the direct hit (v. splash). `Slideshot` is absolutely brilliant once you get the timing right. Check out some [Frostbolt](https://youtu.be/jJFV_4Y6p7s?t=20) highlights.
```
  Barrels [ 28%]: Hard Launch
  Mags    [ 33%]: Spike Grenades

### Ignition Code / PvE / Overview
Ignition Code is the only obtaininable Kinetic GL in the game that can roll with `Blinding Grenades` which, if you're planning on doing anything remotely resembling challenging PvE content, is a must-have. Ehroar put together a [solid review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk53lvImHRU) of Ignotion Code in PvE.
### Ignition Code / PvE / Roll / **"Add Clear - Ehroar's Pick"**
Combining the new `Danger Zone` perk with `Blinding Grenades` means you're practically blinding an entire room each time you fire it. Absolutely top-tier for challenging PvE content. Without `Slideshot` you're stil looking at a phenomenal Grenade Launcher, so a handful of variants are offered without it.
```
  Barrels [ 28%]: Volatile Launch
  Mags    [ 33%]: Blinding Grenades
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Slideshot

### Ignition Code / PvE / Roll / **"Single-Target Damage - Ehroar's Pick"**
This roll is centered around the damage bosts from `Spike Grenades` and `Vorpal Weapon`. Again we're looking to minimize Blast Radius and keep the damage focused on the point of contact. Without `Slideshot` you're stil looking at a phenomenal Grenade Launcher, so a handful of variants are offered without it.
```
  Barrels [ 28%]: Hard Launch

# Sojourner's Tale
*For all possible perks, check out **Sojourner's Tale** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/599895591)*

Sojourner's Tale is a Legendary Slug Shotgun in the Energy slot, introduced in S14.
### Sojourner's Tale / PvP / Overview
From a PvP perspective, slug shotguns come in two flavours:

* High Handling + Low Aim Assist: `Sojourner's Tale`, `First In, Last Out`
* Low Handling + High Aim Assist: `Blasphemer`, `Heritage`, `Bonechiller`

If you love sniping Guardians with slug shotguns and wish you had a Legendary you could use in place of your [Duality](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/3460576091) then you're in luck! Sojourner's offers a solid baseline set of perks that any slug enthusiast will recognize, as well as some interesting new combinations.
### Sojourner's Tale / PvP / Roll / **"The Tale of Coolguy"**
Coolguy has a terrific [video breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iDuWqA5MQM) of Soujourner's Tale. It's the only weapon in the game that can roll with this combo of `Tunnel Vision` and `Killing Wind`, which both proc on reload. What was new to me was that the benefits proc **as soon as a single shell has been reloaded**. You don't have to wait for the full mag to finish!
```
  Barrels [ 22%]: Fluted Barrel

### Sojourner's Tale / PvE / Overview
Slug shotguns got a damage boost in PvE and become DPS machines a few seasons back. If you missed out on a solid [First In, Last Out](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/3616586446) roll, now's your change to secure a workhorse for PvE.
### Sojourner's Tale / PvE / Roll / **"Ehroar's Pick"**
Ehroar has a great [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBgKZmknK2Y) of the Sojourner's Tale. It can't roll with Vorpal but it can roll with Surrounded and Frenzy, both of which provide significant damage bonuses.

# Black Scorpion-4sr
*For all possible perks, check out **Black Scorpion-4sr** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/525750263)*

No general overview as only PvP rolls featured for this one!
### Black Scorpion-4sr / PvP / Overview
[CoolGuy's review (8/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY) is great source of info for the Black Scorpion, as well as the Massive  Breakdown Podcast [Ep. 148](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-148-bygones-last-perdition-and-black-scorpion-4sr-breakdowns). There are seven perks in the final two columns (versus the usual four to six) and during Season 9, this weapon does not benefit from the Rank 92 extra-final-column-perk bonus. That means these rolls are going to be super challenging to get, so we're going to relax a few constraints along the way.
* Recoil is `60`, so using a Counterbalance mod to make it vertical is a slam dunk. Check out CoolGuy's video for a [before/after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY&t=400).
* All these rolls will recommend Rampage in the final column because "Rampage x 1 will kill with four crits in 0.7s."
* The base Range hits max damage at 68m which you're not going to find often on a PvP map, so we're OK with it. We don't want to harm the range, but this roll isn't dying for more range. Mercules904 - "The 2x zoom blows through your range requirements. I really just like this gun more with a heck of a lot of Stability."
* Zen Moment? YES. Stability is where our focus will be. Zen Moment gives you a bump to your base Stability which you can see [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability is a terrific `54`, the highest among all Scout Rifles (?!).
* No Outlaw? NOPE. The reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS perk to play off of in column three. It's not bad, it's just not make-or-break.

Check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnJWuiUF2k) and [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black Scorpion in action. I was surprised to hear how much Mercules904 digs the Black Scorpion (it's the weapon he used to get Randy's).
### Black Scorpion-4sr / PvP / Roll / **"Mercules Collector's Edition"**
Let's call this the "Mercules" roll, since listening to the podcast linked above informed its creation. All Stability, all day, with better Aim Assistance and mobility from `Moving Target`. Because of the quantity of perks in the final two columns, your chance of this roll is... slim.

# BrayTech Werewolf
*For all possible perks, check out **BrayTech Werewolf** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/528834068)*

The BrayTech Werewolf is a 450 RPM "Precision Frame" Kinetic Auto Rifle first introduced in Season 8. It's now available in the 2020 [Festival of the Lost](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/Events/FestivalOfTheLost) event, with random rolls. The only competitive AR archetype right now are the 600s, so you're gambling on an eventual sandbox change for this to be more effective in PvP.
Obtaining this Auto Rifle is a pretty grim affair, behind three levels of RNG:
1. You need Cipher Decoders to drop, which they **have a chance of** doing do at the end of most activities (Ordeal, Strike playlist, Crucible, etc.).
1. You need the Werewolf to drop from a Haunted Forest chest. The chance appears to be something between "never" and "20%" with most folks reporting closer to 5-10%. There's a thread on [/r/DestinyTheGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/jaeitx/horror_story_werewolf_drop_rate_is_2025_chasing/) about it.
1. You need to get the roll you're chasing.

While you are more than welcome to run and grind for these, keep in mind that once you obtain a single drop, you can pull a very good PvE static roll from your collections. Given that 450 RPM ARs haven't been competitive in PvP since Year 1 of Destiny 2, you're prrrobably not missing on much.
### BrayTech Werewolf / PvP / Overview
.
### BrayTech Werewolf / PvP / Roll / **"Werewolves not Swearwolves"**

# Cold Front
*For all possible perks, check out **Cold Front** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/1506719573)*

Cold Front is a 750 RPM Aggressive Frame ("High damage, high recoil") Kinetic Submachine Gun, first introduced long ago during the Season 9 Dawning event. It's back once again with a whole new set of perks from Year 4. If you want to see the old perks, here's a still from [Aztec's review](https://youtu.be/ZK1JPaCASnQ?t=166) in 2019.

[Cold Front Is Back & BETTER Than Ever! (Best Destiny 2 Primary?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG3C1TDUzA8) - Ehroar

> *I believe it's one of the best primaries in the game for PvE* -- Ehroar, Dec. 2020

[IF YOU HAVENT GOT THIS SMG, YOU NEED IT, Cold Front Dawning SMG God Roll Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sFhMUMMttk) - Blyatnid 

> *I have a reason to believe this is the new best primary in the game, full stop* -- Blyatnid, Dec. 2020

Ehroar and co. are excited for a couple of reasons. First, Cold Front has an (obviously) higher rate of fire than its 600 RPM counterpart without being all that much different stat-wise (save for Stability of course). It can also  roll with the new damage-boosting perk `One for All` which we'll get to down in the PvE section below.

If you remember the Cold Front from last year, you'll recall its Stability is one of the lowest in the game at `16`. Technically that's "better" than Hard Truth's `15` though not by much. This is less of an issue on PC than Console, though it's still an issue. However, this time around we have two new tools at our disposal: `Surplus` and `Dynamic Sway Reduction`.
### Cold Front / PvP/PvE Double Duty / Overview
The cornerstones of both PvE and PvP are `Surplus` and `Dynamic Sway Reduction`. The best PvE and PvP rolls center around having one of these perks in column three. If you end up with a "PvE roll" that also happens to have super high Stability, then you've got the Holy Grail of Cold Front rolls. Congrats! For an explanation of these rolls, please read further down towards the specific PvE and PvP sections.

These rolls are floored at `36` Stability (before `Surplus`) since that's the base Stability of other similar SMGS (e.g. Ikelos).

*Yes, these rolls are all based on quotes from the great [Dr. Victor Fries](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000216#quotes).*
### Cold Front / PvP/PvE Double Duty / Roll / **"Endless Winter"**
`Surplus` + `One for All` + all the `Stability` you can get.

### Cold Front / PvP / Overview
You'll notice I didn't include any final column perks. Rampage doesn't meaningfully realistically alter the TTK and Thresh adds so little to your super that it's not worth calling out as the Collector's Edition. Whatever you get in that final column is fine.
### Cold Front / PvP / Roll / **"Ice to See You/Surplus"**
Cold Front needs a lot of help in the Stability department, which is the entire focus of this roll. At best, you'll be able to get Stability up from `16` to `51` plus the benefits coming from Surplus. This puts you way above the base Stability on the vaunted Antiope-D and other Precision Frame SMGs. The Recoil is `92` so be sure to throw on a Counterbalance mod if you don't end up with a +Recoil barrel.

### Cold Front / PvE / Overview
With the addition of `Surplus` and `One for All` to the Cold Front perk pool, we're looking at a strong contender for one of the best kinetic weapons of all time. `Surplus` improves Stability and Reload (two big Cold Front drawbacks) and `One for All` provides a tremendous damage boost and leaves your mod slot free for Minor, Major or Boss Spec.

***`Dragonfly` is going to be replaced by `Swashbuckler` so when you see `Dragonfly` below, you know what it means. The wishlist will be updated after Destiny is updated.***
### Cold Front / PvE / Roll / **"Blizzard"**
While `Surplus` will be boosting Stability, the Stability is so low and difficult to manage on console that we'll continue to crave it as a backstop for when we're at lower tiers of `Surplus` benefits.

# Dire Promise
*For all possible perks, check out **Dire Promise** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/2742838701)*

The Dire Promise is a 140 RPM Hand Cannon that was re-issued all the way back in Season 10 and much has changed. Sunsetting was introduced and then rolled back, 150 RPM HCs were collapsed into the 140 RPM frames and 110 RPMs were upgraded to 120 RPM, turning them into absolute PvP monsters. 140s are middle- of-the-pack but still pack a decent punch.
### Dire Promise / PvP / Overview
With the collapse of 150s > 140s and 110s > 120s, the 140 RPM subtype needs a bit of help. It doesn't have the range of the 120s or the  flinch factor and ease of use of the 180s. Dire Promise is also on the perk pool of Season 10. You have a middling subtype on an old perk pool; what's not to like? 🙃
### Dire Promise / PvP / Roll / **"Promises Made and Kept"**
140s crave Stability. They won't be helped as much by Range as they are by what Stability gives you: an AA cone that resets more quickly than it would otherwise and less kick to correct for.

### Dire Promise / PvE / Overview
Dire Promise is hampered in PvE by having only the old perk pool available. It's likely not your choice for high(er) tier PvE content because of that.
### Dire Promise / PvE / Roll / **"Trustworthy"**
Relying on old reliable perk pairings, this will do work for you in low to mid tier PvE content.

# Glacioclasm
*For all possible perks, check out **Glacioclasm** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/1030895163)*

The Glacioclasm is a High-Impact Frame Fusion Rifle released for the first time in The Dawning, 2020 (Y4 S12). Implicit in the High-Impact frames are that you gain accuracy while crouched: "more accurate when stationary and aiming down sights".

Here are some highlights called out from [CoolGuy's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcKyglpE5UI):

  * Base 1.6 Zoom, versus 1.5 on all other Fusions
  * Best Handling and Stability of all High-Impact Frames
  * Base Range of `67`, "Already at the cap; you don't need any more. It's
  near perfect for the Range that fusions have right now [after the range
  compression nerf]."

From [Fallout's Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7URG6BUl_Q), the difference between a "low range" (67) and "high range" (89) setup is that you gain a single meter before falloff, from 17-18m. That's likely why CoolGuy and Fallout suggest investing in Stability.
### Glacioclasm / PvP / Overview
As mentioned above, the Glacioclasm's base stats are some of the best ever for a High-Impact frame. Because of this, we can narrow our focus on perks and go for some amazing rolls in a post-Erentil world. This is a controller wishlist and so these rolls will primarily focus on `Stability` (which is probably also fine for M&K but apparently M&K players aren't into Fusions as much?)

I [put together a chart](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/wiki/Weapon-Focus-Fusion-Rifles) from Fallout's video above and after some helpful Guardians let me voop 'em in a private match.
### Glacioclasm / PvP / Roll / **"Accelerated Four-Bolter"**
This roll is based around the combination of `Accelerated Coils` and `High-Impact Reserves`. This will allow you to four-bolt Guardians at `9` Resilience with two in the mag (i.e. when you spawn in). I have no Resilience statistics, but checked across three games last night and most people were `2`-`3` with a few around `5`. If you happen to get `Chambered Compensator` be sure to throw on a Counterbalance mod to hit `Recoil:100`.
```

### Glacioclasm / PvP / Roll / **"Stable Four-Bolter"**
Similar to the above, swapping in `Particle Repeater` to replace `Accelerated Coils`, but still centering around `High-Impact Reserves`. Because the Charge Time is slower you can now four-bolt Guardians at any `Resilience` value.
```

### Glacioclasm / PvP / Roll / **"Jittery Four-Bolter"**
There is a unique situation among rolls here that's super interesting. If you have a `Charge Time` Masterwork and `High-Impact Reserves` it means you can four-bolt Guardians at `6` Resilience with two in the mag. That's actually a downgrade from not having a `Charge Time` Masterwork... but(!) you get an upgrade with one in the mag in that you can now four-bolt Guardians with **any** Resilience.

### Glacioclasm / PvP / Roll / **"Slow and Steady Four-Bolter"**
This roll is based around `Liquid Coils`, which allows you to four-bolt Guardians at `9` Resilience. The introduction of `Liquid Coils` opens this roll up quite a bit. You won't find a `Charge Time` Masterwork here because it would drop the roll down to `6` Resilience.

# Gnawing Hunger
*For all possible perks, check out **Gnawing Hunger** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/821154603)*

Gnawing Hunger is a 600 RPM "Adaptive Frame" Energy Auto Rifle first introduced in Season 6. It has been reissued in Season 11, meaning it will be capable of going up to the Season 14 power level cap. Adaptives were buffed Season 10 and unless something changes, will remain very strong through Season 11.
### Gnawing Hunger / PvP / Overview
For grins, [check out ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmbJdlYpD-s) using the generally agreed-upon "God roll" roll with `Tap the Trigger`, `Kill Clip` and a Stability Masterwork.
> "Is there a bug with this gun or is it just really good? I feel like I'm killing too fast right now... like a little bit too fast. I don't get it."

> "This... it feels better than Summoner and SUROS. I can't believe there's a weapon like this in the game and I didn't know about it. I've never seen something like this."

> "Dude what is this TTK? I don't get it! This TTK is a little too fast Bungie."

I hopped in to the Tribute Hall and ran several Recoil pattern tests with various Barrels, Magazines, Perks and Masterworks (Arrowhead, Steady Rounds, Tap the Trigger, etc.). At base Stability and Recoil (on console at least), it's pretty hard to control.

There are two ways to get Gnawing Hunger to hone in for you:
1. **Tap the Trigger**: The most noticeable difference in bullet concentration comes from TtT. If you want a laser beam, you want TtT. That being said, if you *only* get TtT and no other Stability or Recoil perks, it's not nearly as easy to control as it could be.
2. **Arrowhead + Counterbalance**: This combo *absolutely works* as well. I was able to cluster rounds around small targets just fine, without TtT. If you don't get Zen Moment or Tap the Trigger in the third column, but you do get Arrowhead Brake in the first column, you might find it totally capable, especially if you're on PC.

What you **really** want is to slam all these perks together for maximum Stability and minimal Recoil, and that's what we're going to break down below.
### Gnawing Hunger / PvP / Roll / **"Drifter Hungry"**
Going for as much `Recoil` and `Stability` improvement as we can get. `Kill Clip` is phenomenal on the Gnawing Hunger, bumping your optimal TTK from `8c1b/0.80s` to `6c1b/0.60s`.
```
  Barrels [ 22%]: Arrowhead Brake
  Mags    [ 25%]: Steady Rounds
  Perks 1 [ 40%]: Tap the Trigger, Zen Moment
  Perks 2 [ 20%]: Kill Clip

# Hawkmoon
*For all possible perks, check out **Hawkmoon** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/3856705927)*

Hawkmoon is a 140 RPM Exotic Hand Cannon, re-issued from Destiny 1 featuring random rolls! The base stats are terrific and it's hard to argue that any single roll is "bad" per se, but there are certainly some rolls that are more desireable than others from a min/max'ers perspective.

If you haven't already **complete the catalyst**! Completing it grants you the masterwork:
> "Increased magazine size. Grants increased handling, reload and weapon range based on the number of stacks of Paracausal Charge."

I'm going to be using video reviews from a few folks in choosing which rolls to share.


  * Aztecross - [Hawkmoon RE-review (Which Perk is the Best? My Opinion)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhkQ0ZBplh0)
  * CammyCakes - [Hawkmoon's FINAL Form | Best Rolls!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txVe9oMUshU)
  * Drewsky - [The Hawkmoon God Roll Isn't What I Expected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4nBwU6opJk)
  * Fallout - [DON’T Run This Perk on Hawkmoon! The True GOD ROLL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCgo41bYjAo)


From Drewsky's, here are some effective ranges:


  | Perks          | Range |
  |----------------|-------|
  | Corkscrew | 31.2m      |
  | Smallbore  |   31.5m   |
  | Hammer-Forged    |   31.5m   |
  | Full Bore   |   32.5m   |
  | Smallbore + Rangefinder   | 34.2m |
  | Hammer-Forged + Rangefinder  |   34.5m   |
  | Hammer-Forged + Killing Wind (Active)   |   35m   |
  | Full Bore + Rangefinder  |   35.5m (est.)  |


There aren't any PvE rolls featured below. Watching Hawkmoon w/Paracausal x7 chunk down enemies is truly rewarding (as is hearing CAWWW!). There are no perks or combinations of perks that make a roll more or less effective in PvE beyond whatever personal preference adds consistency for you. There's an argument to be made that the answer to that question is "Use PvP rolls which are all about adding consistency" 🙃
### Hawkmoon / PvP / Overview

## Honor's Edge - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Honor's Edge** over on [light.gg]()*


Honor's Edge (HE) is available in the World Drops loot pool in Season 11, originally being re-issued back in Season 10. The main difference between HE and SS14 is that HE can roll with `Surrounded` and `Flash Counter`, two both amazing perks.

* `Surrounded` + `Surrounded Spec` ends up giving you a massive 35% damage increase and since a Sword is in-your-face there's a high chance you'll proc this regularly.
* `Flash Counter` not only disorients but  [applies a 20% debuff](https://youtu.be/b9HcFqLdlyQ?t=1477)! This means *all incoming damange* is upped by 20%. You can imagine how helpful this would be in Public Events (like the S11 Contact event), to debuff the boss with up to eleven other Guardians attacking. The debuff lasts for five seconds, so you'll need to periodically switch to blocking for this to take effect. Given that every boss in the game stomps, this is a great way to take out your anti-stomp rage 😡


Fortunately the perk set is very small and chances are you'll get the roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll will keep you all the way through Season 13.

*Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the case*
* **(PvE) "Lawnmower Man" 🚜🚜🚜 Collector's Edition - 1.1% chance**: With Surrounded up, you'll be mowing through hordes of adds in no time. C/o [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/), Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed stat you won't notice the difference.

## Interference VI - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Interference VI** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2257180473/interference-vi/)*


The Interference VI (IVI) is not a Season 11 re-issue, but it is one of small number of weapons in the World Drop Power Weapon loot pool. Grenade Launchers haven't been meta PvE DPS for some time, so why record wishlist rolls for this? A couple of reasons:

* This reissued IVI can now roll Full Court. The only other GLs that can roll Full Court are `Doomsday` and `Love and Death`, both of which are capped at end of Season 11 (i.e. 1060PL). Full Court, at max range (> 50m) has a 25% damage increase. It's worth picking up!
* The perk pool is really small, with only four possibilities in the final two columns, which slightly offsets the number of perks in the first and second columns.
* While it's not a S11 re-issue (i.e. power cap of 1310 and not 1360), it will still be useful for the next two seaons, so if you get a decent roll then it will have some longevity to it.

The Power weapon pool is so small that you're going to buried under mountains of these. Chances are without even trying you're going to get a pretty decent roll. Enjoy your New Monarchy Grenader Launcher! :)
* **(PvE) "From Dooowwwwntown" 🏀🏀🏀Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: If the stars align, you'll get one that bumps Velocity as high as possible.

## Jian 7 Rifle - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Jian 7 Rifle** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1162247618/jian-7-rifle/)*


This Jian 7 is the randomly-rolled successor to the New Monarchy Pulse of the same name from days gone by. It's a 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle which is mostly the same as the Last Perdition which also rolls in this slot. The most important difference is that the Jian's base recoil is `80` which means that with a Counterbalance mod, it will be effectively perfectly vertical at `95`. Contrast with the Last Perdition whose base Recoil is `63` ( [detailed comparison](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BFRn3C;LQhzo) on light.gg)

It has notable perk placement differences; perks are mostly similar with some slotting variations. There are no Rampage-based perks here because it doesn't make it any easier to off enemies unless you're at x 2 which is too situational for a solid recommendation.

Everything written in the thoughts for [Last Perdition](#last-perdition---pvp) holds here as well, so I won't repeat all of that.
* **(PvP) Absurdly Planted 🌱🌱🌱 🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: `Firmly Planted` is criminally underrated. It's a difference in playstyle that you have to work at, but you will absolutely be rewarded. This perk alone is why the Jian 7 and Last Perdition have become two of my most-used pulses.

## Last Perdition - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Last Perdition** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/188882152/last-perdition/)*


A randomly-rolled 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle; here we go! If you like Bygones in the primary slot, Last Perdition is right up your alley. It was brought back in Season of the Drifter with random rolls, and it unfortunately kept a pretty baseline set of perks. There's so much magic happening in the Energy slot now that we're so deep into Destiny 2 that we're going to have a pretty high bar for rolls here.

Lots of resources for this one, including the [Destiny Massive Breakdowns](https://www.destinymassivebreakdowns.com/) [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns). I'll be quoting (or paraphrasing if I couldn't keep up :) Kyt_Kucha and Mercules904 quite a bit in here.
* Kyt: "Stability helps your Aim Assist cone recover more quickly. Recoil makes the bursts more linear but it's not the same thing as having more Stability."
* Kyt: "Wouldn't go with a zoom factor of less than 3 because otherwise you feel recoil too much"
* M904: "Accurized Rounds for +10 range, but maybe not if you picked a medium to high zoom scope (go for more Stability)"
* M904: "Remember that Range has a linear effect and Zoom has a multiplicative effect. Rangefinder is 0.1x zoom - be careful of it because it may push you too far. Using it with +2x SPO-26 would be a good combo. If you don't roll Rangefinder but you do roll a higher zoom scope, you can ignore Rangefinder. If you only have short-zoom scopes, use Rangefinder."
* CoolGuy's review: [Last Perdition 2.0 In Depth Review - Top Tier Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVNWTEttc) is terrific. Long zoom scopes aren't recommended because of the increased incoming flinch while ADS and they also decrease Handling which can make the weapon feel more sluggish. `Zen Moment` is capped out at 66% of Base Stability, which is super high at 66, so we're going to prioritize that.

For some general slaying footage, ZkMushroom loves his Last Perdition! Here he is on PC -  ["My Favorite Pulse Rifle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jXTmYiHbWQ) - and earlier on console - ["Last Perdition is the Best Pulse Rifle in the  Game?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwucqcnyX-s). "I don't like laning with pulses. I know Blast Furnace and Bygones will be better there. I like being aggressive with my pulse and this is the perfect one."
* **(PvP) Absurdly Sticky 🍭🍭🍭Collector's Edition - 0.8% chance**: With `Moving Target` and `Zen Moment`, your weapon should only produce yellow numbers. We'd also be thrilled to get `Firmly Planted` here!

## Last Perdition - PvE

When Last Perdition was brought back with random rolls in the Season of the Drifter, it came back with the standard perk pool from Destiny 2 Year 1. Not a ton of finesse here in the rolls we're looking for :)

## Night Watch - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Night Watch** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3504336176/night-watch/)*


Night Watch is a 200 RPM Scout Rifle that dropped during Season of the Drifter (S6). It has been re-issued in Season of Arrivals (S11) and is the only 200 RPM Scout Rifle in the game that is currently available. [CoolGuy's review (5/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1KGJ7WU9es) remains a great source of info for Night Watch. It's a bit over a year old, but the sandbox hasn't changed materially around 200 RPM Scouts (for better or worse) or the perks he talks through.

200 RPM Scouts (including the Night Watch) are far from meta. Even the strongest of the bunch (MIDA) you never see. The maps aren't really designed for Scouts, perhaps save for Rusted Lands? and 200 RPM Scouts struggle against the powerhouses like Jade Rabbit.

And now the section where I feel like I have to justify not just picking Outlaw + Rampage/Kill Clip on every weapon in the game 😃

* I am not suggesting Outlaw because the base `Reload` is already plenty fast. Outlaw isn't bad here per se, there's just not a strong reason to choose it.
* Conversely, I am suggesting Rapid Hit because even though it was [changed in S11](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49126), it's still a solid perk.
* I am not suggesting Rampage because at x1 it does not alter the TTK (it does at x2).
* Conversely, I am suggesting Multikill Clip because it does alter the TTK (3H1B > 3H0B).

Similar to my thoughts on 180 RPM Hand Cannons, I do think Explosive Payload is very strong here. The explosions have no damage falloff and with the high rate of fire, it means your target is constantly flinched (almost annoying so). Here's a  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0uI-KZnD70) from Drewsky demonstrating how High Caliber Rounds and Explosive Payload work.
> "[Explosive Rounds] made the crosshairs jerk horizontally while rising and reaching its peak resulting in more irregular and disorienting flinch patterns [than High-Caliber Rounds]."

This was the same basis of my suggestion for Explosive Payload on the Patron of Lost Causes back in Season of the Dawn (S9). I think it's similarly strong here, especially in sixes where you're likely to get additional assist points from Explosive Payload when people are clumped together.

Because of the high RPM, I'm also going to suggest we shoot for as much `Stability` as we can get to increase the recovery of the Aim Assist cone between shots.

## Night Watch - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Night Watch** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3504336176/night-watch/)*


Night Watch is a 200 RPM Scout Rifle that dropped during Season of the Drifter (S6). It has been re-issued in Season of Arrivals (S11) and is the only 200 RPM Scout Rifle in the game that is currently available. [CoolGuy's review (5/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1KGJ7WU9es) remains a great source of info for Night Watch. It's a bit over a year old, but the sandbox hasn't changed materially around 200 RPM Scouts (for better or worse) or the perks he talks through.

Classic combos carry the day here - reload perks combined with damage boosting perks, and as much Range as we can get.

# Shadow Price
*For all possible perks, check out **Shadow Price** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/2633186522)*

Shadow Price is a 450 RPM Precision Frame, Arc Energy Auto Rifle, offered as a Nightfall-exclusive reward beginning in Season 13. It's the only 450 RPM Auto Rifle dropping apart from the Kinetic Seventh Seraph Carbine; [compare them](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=Cc8zza;BdCxNP) over on light.gg. Shadow Price has by far the better perk pool (One for All, Surplus, Feeding Frenzy...) whereas the Carbine can create Warmind Cells, which alone is a reason to use it.
### Shadow Price / PvP / Overview
450s haven't been great in PvP since the first year of Destiny 2. 600 RPMs like the Gnawing Hunger and Summoner still reign supreme, and will continue to do so until 450s are buffed. What makes the Shadow Price even less desirable for PvP is the lack of PvP perks that AR users would find interesting in either column. No Dynamic Sway, Tap the Trigger, etc. which makes sense since it's a reward for a PvE activity. Once the Grandmaster NFs appear and Adept mods are accessible, perhaps Adept Counterbalance, Stability, etc. could make it more desireable. Really though, until they're buffed, 450 RPMs may be frustrating to deploy against meta weapons.
### Shadow Price / PvP / Roll / **"Crushing Darkness"**
With either Arrowhead Brake or Chambered Compensator + Counterbalance, you can hit `100` Recoil. Everythign else is this roll is about maximzing Stability. The final column doesn't have any must-have perks; anything there is gravy. Sure Swashbuckler would be nice to have, but it doesn't complete a picture, so I've left the final column empty. With at least two abilities active, Surplus is going to grant a noticeable improvement to Stability, Handling and Reload speed giving this roll a snappy, almost Lightweight-Frame feel.

### Shadow Price / PvE / Overview
450s (and ARs in general) are in a tough spot for PvE. [Ehroar demonstrates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yeyr60J8K6A) this comprehensively: they have a confusing damage profile compared to other alternatives in that slot. If Shadow Price were a kinetic, perhaps less so, but the Energy slot is so loaded with great weapons that it's hard to imagine this being your top choice in its current state. That being said, frame buffs are always a thing and 450s seem long overdue for one!
### Shadow Price / PvE / Roll / **"Overflowing Darkness (Aztec's Pick)"**
One for All is a 33% damage boost after tagging three targets. Pair it with Overflow you've got a deep mag to burn down while OFA is active. If you want this to feel like a laser, Arrowhead Brake is your pick in the first column, taking the Recoil from 79 to 100. It also boosts Handling by nearly 20%, which you'll notice on ready, stow and aiming. See [Aztec's Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QEKwveuh8M).

### Shadow Price / PvE / Roll / **"Steady Sparks in the Night"**
On full-auto weapons, Dragonfly can be tough to proc. 450s are right in that sweet spot where at medium-to-longer ranges, getting Dragonfly to proc regularly is a real possibility. To help with that, we're going to go for better Recoil and Stability with the rest of the roll.

# Stars in Shadow
*For all possible perks, check out **Stars in Shadow** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/2050789284)*

Stars in Shadow is a 340 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Energy Pulse Rifle introduced in Destiny 2 Year 4 (Beyond Light). See [how it compares](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=B6PI-k;BIfK-Z;BFN60K;) to the existing High-Impacts that lit up in Season 11. It's a Crucible drop and if you're an avid PvP player, you'll be swimming in these rolls in no time. It's a solid Pulse Rifle with good base stats, a clean sight and a great feel. I'm sure you'll see more coverage in the coming weeks as people settle in to Beyond Light and Season 12.

***"Why are the odds for these rolls so low?"*** The final two columns typically have four to six perks in them. In the case of Stars in Shadow, they each have twelve.

***"Why don't you have any rolls with Thresh?"*** Thresh doesn't seem to be all that game-changing (1-3% Super bonus on kill) and doesn't synergize with other perks, so we're skipping it.
### Stars in Shadow / PvP / Overview
These rolls are going to be similar to those we captured in our coverage of [Cold Denial](#cold-denial---pvp) as it's a comparable 340 RPM.

***"Why don't you have any Outlaw or Feeding Frenzy PvP rolls?"***

Good question! Glove mod slots are inexpensive and not contentious in PvP. If you want much faster reload, throw on a two-Energy Pulse Rifle Reload mod. Feeding Frenzy was changed to provide a noticeable benefit after three successive kills, so I no longer recommend it for PvP.
### Stars in Shadow / PvP / Roll / **"Vertical/Dark Side"**
This set of rolls is all about maxing out Recoil, and keeps `Arrowhead Brake` constant as our barrel. You have the option of achieving `100` Recoil by slotting in a Counterbalance mod. If not, go nuts with your nearly perfectly vertical `94`. `Killing Wind` is S-tier and you'd be happy to get any of the final column perks.

### Stars in Shadow / PvP / Roll / **"The Vertical/Hoarder"**
This set of rolls pivots around `Surplus`. It provides a roughly 25%, 13% and 8% boost depending on how many abilities are charged. You really want to be shooting for all three abilities charged at once which means either foregoing their use entirely or perhaps investing in high tiers of the respective stat (Strength, Discipline, or <class stat>) so that you can quickly recharge a single one. The tradeoff is going around with a supercharged weapon the whole match.

### Stars in Shadow / PvE / Overview
In PvE you're going for as much `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. There are some solid perks here not in our rolls, becase you don't need this wishlist to tell you that Demolitionist is a good perk 🙃
### Stars in Shadow / PvE / Roll / **"Rapid Reload"**

## Steel Sybil Z-14 - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Steel Sybil Z-14** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4230993599/steel-sybil-z-14/)*


The Steel Sybil is a re-issue of the Crucible sword from the launch of Forsaken back in Season 4. The perks are the same as they've always been so unfortunately this Season (Season 11) will be about (re?)chasing your best roll from the past nearly two years. Whomp whomp.

Fortunately the perk set is very small and chances are you'll get the roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll will keep you all the way through Season 14.

"But Slif, Falling Guillotine is void and is way better DPS. Why would I keep a Steel Sybil around?" Great question, let's turn it over to Joe:
> Futureproofing if they better differentiate the role of the two frames. But given the small sword perk pool, it's never really been hard to scrounge up a serviceable weapon at the time you need it. I'd imagine guillotine will become better for wide damage, sybil better for single target. But as of today, you only need guillotine.

Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the case :)
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS 🗡🗡🗡 Collector's Edition - 2.7% chance**: With Whirlwind and Relentless you'll be slicing for what seems like forever. C/o [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/), Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed stat you won't notice the difference.

  ```
  Barrels [ 40%]: Jagged Edge
  Mags    [ 40%]: Swordmaster's Guard
  Perks 1 [ 50%]: Relentless Strikes
  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Whirlwind Blade
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS 🗡🗡 (Minus Magazines) - 6.7% chance**: Same as the CE, minus Heavy Guard. That's OK because you won't be doing all that much defending while slicing away with your sword.

  ```
  Barrels [ 40%]: Jagged Edge
  Mags    [100%]: *
  Perks 1 [ 50%]: Relentless Strikes
  Perks 2 [ 33%]: Whirlwind Blade
  MWorks  [100%]: *
  ```
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS 🗡 (Baseline) - 16.7% chance**: You really only need these two to do phenomenal amounts of sustained damage and fortunately they're pretty easy to find!

# Stochastic Variable
*For all possible perks, check out **Stochastic Variable** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/2272470786)*

The Stochastic Variable is a 900 RPM SMG initially introduced as part of the Faction Rallies event and was part of the Future War Cult loot pool. It was reintroduced with random rolls in S14 and has access to some of the new perks introduced with Beyond Light, but none of the S14-specific new perks (e.g. `Danger Zone`).

It seems to be universally panned in PvP and highly regarded in PvE, so only PvE rolls will be featured. With the introduction of the [Shayura's Wrath](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/3682803680) Trials of Osiris reward, it gets some stiff competition in the PvP SMG space.
### Stochastic Variable / PvE / Overview
Stochastic Variable is a sleeper at the moment, but with a Warmind Cell nerf of sorts likely incoming, it's a great alternative to pick up once your Ikelos SMG becomes perhaps a bit less useful.
### Stochastic Variable / PvE / Roll / **"Recluse 2.0 - Ehroar's Pick"**
With `Feeding Frenzy` and `Multikill Clip` you're turning an already terrific weapon into a Recluse-like machine.

But still great! While `Feeding Frenzy` is the winner in Column 3, `Ambitious Assassin` and `Surplus` will also put in work. This is the same roll as the above with those just two swapped in, in lieu of `Feeding Frenzy`.

# The Number
*For all possible perks, check out **The Number** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/2492081469)*

The Number is a 450 RPM Precision Frame, Arc Energy Auto Rifle, offered as a random roll beginning in Season 14. It initially appeared years ago in the "Faction Rallies" events as part of the Future War Cult weapon pool. It [compares closely](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=CUiiU9;Cc8zza;) to the Shadow Price, a Nightfall-only reward offerd in Season 13.
### The Number / PvP / Overview
450s haven't been great in PvP since the first year of Destiny 2. In S14 they received a minor buff to precision damage though it doesn't appear to have made a dent in the overall PvP meta. It isn't that they're "bad" per se, it's that so many other weapons are so good. Well, with one of the worst body-shot TTKs in the game I think some folks might state that they are actually "bad" 🤷

As 450s go, The Number is perhaps a bit more interesting because its base `Recoil` is `70` which means you have a number of options to 'fix' the Recoil to vertical. Archetype and Recoil aside, The Number doesn't have a whole lot of PvP perks to choose from so we won't have too many rolls here.
### The Number / PvP / Roll / **"Sheikh's Choice"**
Mr. Fun Police himself nabbed an [absolutely phenomenal roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LozV7KaCHs) which happens to be this one right here. Just getting a single kill and activating `Multikill Clip x 1` takes you from a `6h2b/0.93s` to a `6h0b/0.67s` TTK. This place nicely with an ability or two up with `Surplus`, to get those crispy reloads.

### The Number / PvP / Roll / **"Feedback Loop"**
Classic combo here. `Surplus` and `Wellspring` were introduced in the same season and compliment each other nicely. `Wellspring` takes some of the edge off the reluctance to use abilities when running with a `Surplus`-based primary.

### The Number / PvE / Overview
450s (and ARs in general) are in a tough spot for PvE. [Ehroar demonstrates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yeyr60J8K6A) this comprehensively: they have a confusing damage profile compared to other alternatives in that slot. If The Number were a kinetic, perhaps less so, but the Energy slot is so loaded with great weapons that it's hard to imagine this being your top choice in its current state. That being said, frame buffs are always a thing and 450s seem long overdue for one!
### The Number / PvE / Roll / **"One-for-All is the Loneliest"**
PvE tends to be quite ability-heavy so `Surplus` might not be up that often but it's gravy when it is, helping you maximize the uptime of `One-for-All` and refreshing `Multikill Clip`.

## Timelines' Vertex - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Timelines' Vertex** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3055192515/timelines-vertex/)*


This Timelines' Vertex is the randomly-rolled successor to the Future  War Cult version of the same name from days gone by. While it uses a reskinned version of the Erentil, it is unfortunately not also a High- Impact Frame. Fusions had a pretty nasty nerf in S11, discussed in [roll comments](#hollow-words---pvp) on the Hollow Words.

Since it's an Adaptive Frame, you need 6/7 bolts to hit and if you want  to OHK it needs to be within 17m, which is pretty darn close and pretty darn difficult when you factor in opponent mobility. SMGs and sidearms are arguably more effective within this range because they give you more mobility options and can more readily be used against mobile opponents. Increasing the Range will not increase falloff for Fusions at the moment.

I can only really reccomend this type of Fusion Rifle to aficionados.
* **(PvP) Shieldbreaker 🛡🛡🛡 🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.1% chance**: If you're able to OHK, terrific! If not, chances are you're at least breaking shields and with a quick swap to a primary, you have an interesting combo. Typically I would go for more Stability but you're getting all of that from Firmly Planted so we can opt for Range perks where we can.

If you're a member of the [Fighting Lion Club](https://www.fightinglion.club/) or are looking for a replacement once your Mountaintop can no longer be infused, give Truthteller a try.

Truthteller is part of the "Lightweight Frame" grenade launchers (breach-loaded, single shot). Lightweight grenade launchers all have a "remote detonation" ability where they detonate when you release the trigger (or you get a direct hit). These weapons have a very high skill ceiling, allowing banked shots and shots that explode next to enemies in cover.

In PvP, this weapon excels at starting engagements rather than finishing them. We want Truthteller to soften our enemies up, even if we don't get a direct hit.

There are a couple of perks that help us meet this goal:
- Auto Loading Holster - be ready for that next engagement with a fully loaded weapon
- Disruption Break - breaking an opponents shield gives kinetic weapons a 50% buff.
   Quick swapping to a kinetic primary ammo weapon will allow for quick cleanup (likely
   a one-shot/one-burst)


I'll be pairing this with the `Quick Access Sling` mod as it'll proc with every shot and let us more quickly clean up what we've started.
* **(PvP) "Sheildbreaker" 🛡🛡🛡🌟 Collector's Edition - 1.1% chance**: Break their shields with Disruption Break and clean them up with a kinetic. We're looking for velocity and blast radius here.

## Truthteller - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Truthteller** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1946491241/truthteller/)*


In PvE there are a couple of roles that Truthteller can fill, and a number of great perks to look for.

Blinding grenades have a 10 meter radius on a 5 second suppression effect which works on all non-Ultra/Champion mobs.  In high-level PvE content, this can be really useful for suppressing a large area and having an entire fireteam do damage without worrying about retaliation.  [Ehroar](https://youtu.be/8cA0X0yptco?t=70) calls Blinding Grenades:

> Blinding Grenades are one of the most underrated pieces of utility in the game...[Truthteller] is something I'm going to definitely consider taking into the next raid.

As of Season 11, it feels like there's some sort of bug or issue with Concussion Grenades.  They have the same -50 penalty to blast radius of Blinding Grenades and also have the same 5s duration to the effect, but their area of effect is only a 5 meter radius (~25% of the total area impacted).

Spike Grenades can also be good if you're looking to do direct damage.  Truthteller isn't quite at Mountaintop levels of damage, but it's probably the best thing we have as a replacement.   In testing, Mountaintop with Spike Grenades does 21,048 damage.  Truthteller with Spike Grenades does 15,185, so about 28% less.

Auto-loading Holster is the best 3rd column perk for almost every situation, the only possible exception is using Field Prep and crouching for faster reload if you're looking to spam this weapon.

Normally, damage boosting perks like Swashbuckler and Multi-Kill clip are highly sought after on weapons, but for this archetype, it's fairly hard to keep those chains going enough to make them worth their while.

Demolitionist is the best 4th column PvE pick as it has the dual effect of increasing the number of grenades you get, and filling the chamber with a shell after throwing a grenade.

Disruption Break is also viable and for some situations would be amazing to help bring a tough blinded enemy down (now if Bungie would ever allow grenade launchers to have an Anti-Barrier mod, this would be _amazing_).

This weapon is void and works really well for Voidlocks running Nezarac's Sin.  I've had a lot of fun pairing it with Falling Guillotine (also void) and Bad Juju for very fast grenade and super regeneration.  Add in some mods like Blast Radius (get Charged with Light for GL kills), Lucent Blade (extra sword damage), Protective Light (50% damage received when your shield breaks), Dire Artillery (extra super on GL kills), and Oppressive Darkness (enemies take 35% more damage).   This is the build I'll be running for the rest of the season.
* **(PvE) "Blinded by Science" 🧪🧪🧪🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: Open up an engagement on a group of enemies by suppressing them all with blindness

# Heritage
*For all possible perks, check out **Heritage** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/4248569242)*

Heritage is a kinetic "precision frame" (slug) shotgun that can drop from the 2nd and 3rd encounters of the Deep Stone Crypt raid.  After the initial drop, you have a chance of getting additional rolls from the raid's secret chests.
As of Season 12, it is the only legendary kinetic slug shotgun that is viable in leveled content.
### Heritage / PvE / Overview
Slug shotguns currently enable some of the highest DPS in the game, and are the meta-loadout for boss DPS in a number of encounters, including the final boss of the raid.
### Heritage / PvE / Roll / **"Re-Re-Re-Re-Combo Breaker!"**
Reconstruction is a new perk that currently only drops on rolls from the DSC Raid.  Every 4 seconds it loads 10% of the base magazine from reserves into the gun, and it maxes out at 2x the normal magazine size.  It starts at a base of 6 (12) but with Extended Mag and the Backup Mag mod you can get up to 8 (16) shots without reloading!
None of the traditional damage perks (Rampage, Kill Clip, Vorpal) are available on this gun, so our best bet for the 4th column is another new perk, Recombination.  Final blows from all "elemental" sources (so, everything that isn't this shotgun) stack up to 10x.  Each stack will add 10% for the next Heritage shot (so up to 2x damage).
```
  Barrels [ 58%]: Full Bore, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore
  Mags    [ 71%]: Tactical Mag, Extended Mag, Assault Mag
  Perks 1 [ 16%]: Reconstruction
  Perks 2 [ 16%]: Recombination
  MWorks  [ 50%]: Handling MW, Range MW

### Heritage / PvP / Overview
Heritage has the highest aim assist of any slug shotgun.  [Drewsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUGZIasUu9o) says "this weapon is really comparable to The Chaperone."
The base one hit kill range is 10.5 meters, you can increase that up to 11.9m with Killing Wind and Slideshot active.
### Heritage / PvP / Roll / **"Killing Slide"**
All Range and all damage.

## Bite of the Fox - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Bite of the Fox** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3169616514/bite-of-the-fox/)*


Bite of the Fox is a Kinetic-slot, Aggressive Frame sniper. It's been in the Iron Banner loot pool since Season 4 and has been re-issued in Season 11. This means if you *had* a BOTF, it will hit the level cap this season, so you'll want to get a new roll to take you past Season 11.

Aggressive Frame snipers are the only ones that can one-shot every super in the Crucible. Every super has a different damage-resistance tier that affects your ability to do that however Aggressive Frames do not care about such things.

The perk pool is unchanged in the re-issue, so we have a pretty simple set of rolls we're chasing.

With respect to PvE below, there's no Triple- Tap, Fourth Time's the Charm, Vorpal, etc. so I'd suggest you use something else in PvE in the Kinetic slot. If you absolutely had to have one, maybe [`Firmly Planted` + `Field Prep`]?
* **(PvP) "Snappy Opener" 🤞🤞🤞🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.3% chance**: This series of rolls is based around Snapshot and Accuracy-increasing final-column perks. After that, we're looking for as much `Range` and `Handling` as we can get.

## Crimil's Dagger - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Crimil's Dagger** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4292849692/crimils-dagger/)*


Crimil's is a 110 RPM Kinetic, Aggressive Frame Hand Cannon that has been re-issued in Season 11 with a higher power cap. It features the same perk pool its always had and since 110s haven't been touched over the years dince Destiny 2's launch, it's going to be a pretty limited set of perks we're interested in.

I wouldn't call 110s the meta (far from it) or really all that competitive at the moment. My guess is that new perks will appear on these to create interesting or alternative options, because the 110s hit so hard it would be tough to imagine how they could otherwise make them stronger without unbalancing them.

There is one niche where they **really** shine, and that's if you want to use them for cleanup kills after zinging someone with a bow or sniper body shot. They are the only Hand Cannon archetype where a crit can OHK-cleanup in that playstyle. In terms of 1:1 duels, they punish you for missing and you will not adequately flinch your opponents compared to ARs, 150 HCs, Pulses, etc.
* **(PvP) "Magnetic Bullets" 🧲🧲🧲🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.0% chance**: One of the rare weapons that can roll with both `Moving Target` and `Opening Shot` at the same time. The 110s have a punishing kick so after that, we're going for `Stability`.

## Crimil's Dagger - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Crimil's Dagger** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/4292849692/crimils-dagger/)*


The perk pool here is before the new good stuff started rolling out, so there's not too many surprises. The only damage-dealing perk is `Kill Clip` but we have a few ways to reload quickly.

Part of the added challenge with these old weapons is that the perk pools are so large the chances of getting what you want is quite low.

## Fool's Remedy - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Fool's Remedy** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/65611680/the-fools-remedy/)*


Fool's Remedy is "SUROS Rapid-Fire" (i.e. fully automatic) 450 RPM Sidearm that has been re-issued in Season 11's Iron Banner. The Remedy is the only SUROS-RF sidearm in the game apart from `Dead Man Walking` whose power cap is the current Season (11).

If you're going to chase a single weapon from Season 11 Iron Banner (thus far), the Fool's Remedy is the one to go for. People are raving about it because of how it performs at base, its available perks, and that those perks now include the new Iron Banner specific perks: `Iron Gaze` and `Iron Grip`.

* Aztecross - ["Fools Remedy Review (Fantastic Sidearm)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOqRgxg1dIA)
* Destiny Fun Police - ["The Fools Remedy - Returning Iron Banner Sidearm"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zeeXHNls1M)
* IFrostBolt - ["The Must Have Sidearm (Fool's Remedy)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6qeCktTYY)
* MTashed - ["This Sidearm Suprised Me! The Fool's Remedy Iron Banner Sidearm"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmIhv_j7Yuo)
* TrueVanguard - ["This New Iron Banner Sidearm is NUTS"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frkRY-HSUQE)

As is pleasantly becoming the norm in Season 11, it's hard to pick a single "god roll" for this sidearm. We're trending towards a lack of unequivocally "best" rolls (or even best-per-input-type) and that's going to make the Destiny sandbox a lot more interesting, especially as the first batch of weapons sunset this season.

We're going to proceed with these starting from the last perk and working our way backwards. I agree with CoolGuy that the two most important perks are the final columns and you build the rest of the roll around them. Fortunately there are so many great possibilities here, you stand a good chance of landing multiple rolls!
* **(PvP) "In my Sights" 👓👓👓🌟 Collector's Edition - 1.0% chance**: Working backwards from `Iron Gaze` (+20 AA), we're going for as much `Stability` as we can. We'd end choosing the rest of the roll similarly if we landed `Kill Clip` or `Eye of the Storm` in the final slot, so we'll combine these rolls.

## Orewing's Maul - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Orewing's Maul** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2108920981/orewings-maul/)*


Orewing's is almost identical to the [Truthteller](#truthteller---pvp) in every way, save for a much less excellent perk pool. Truthteller has more interesting combinations, but if you're swimming in GL's from Iron Banner and really want to keep one, read on.

[Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXhfIXnPTT4) (aka DFP) first popularized these back in Year 1 of Destiny 2 when he used the Fighting Lion to great affect.

Like Truthteller, Orewing's is part of the "Lightweight Frame" grenade launchers (breach-loaded, single shot). Lightweight grenade launchers all have a "remote detonation" ability where they detonate when you release the trigger (or you get a direct hit). These weapons have a very high skill ceiling, allowing banked shots and shots that explode next to enemies in cover. In PvP, these weapons excel at starting engagements rather than finishing them. We want Orewing's to soften our enemies up, even if we don't get a direct hit.

Let's talk perks, and why you probably want a Truthteller instead ;)
* **Column 2**: Here you have a choice between `Spike`, `Blinding` and `Concussion` grenades. Blinding grenades flash your screen white and slowly subside whereas Concussion grenades jerk your camera dramatically, like being hit by a tether. Either Concussion or Blinding grenades are bugged because Blinding's radius is massive whereas Concussion requires a near direct hit. With such a wide radius, you can practically gaurantee that you'll be able to blind folks in PvP so I tend to suggest `Blinding`. What about `Promixity`? The proximity detonation radius is so miniscule that you may as well use `Spike` if you're that accurate. Firing at enemies in the Tribute Hall and you have to give them a buzz cut for `Proximity` to proc.
* **Column 3**: Only one perk in this column has utility in PvP and that's `Quickdraw`.
* **Column 4** : Only one perk in this column has utility in PvP and that's Auto-Loading Holster. `Rangefinder`, `Moving Target` and `Snapshot` don't help us at all, because you're always hip-firing. `Demolitionist` only procs on kills and we're using these to open, not to close. If you get any other perk than ALH in this slot, it will unfortunately go to waste.

In the immortal words of [@tednaleid](https://github.com/tednaleid) "I'm not sure why Bungie created both of these weapons" and it's true! It's hard to see why you'd run an Orewing's over a Truthteller. Heck it's hard to see why you'd run an Orewing's at all given the two most important slots have near zero utility in PvP.

Remember to pair this with the `Quick Access Sling` mod as it'll proc with every shot and let us more quickly clean up what we've started.

This section is the same as the Truthteller PvE writeup. [Have a look](#truthteller---pve) and come on back!

The main difference is that the perks on Orewing's are in different columns, so we don't have as many choices.

# The Steady Hand
*For all possible perks, check out **The Steady Hand** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/2220884262)*

The Steady Hand (TSH) is a 120 RPM "Aggressive Frame" Kinetic Hand Cannon, re-issued in Year 4 with random rolls. Prior to Season 12 in November 2020, Aggressive Frames were bumped from 110 RPM to 120 RPM as part of a [large scale Hand Cannon rework](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49676). The general consensus thus far is that TSH is terrific.

> *The Steady Hand is probably the most consistent legendary 120 RPM aggressive hand cannon.* - Drewsky

* [Drewsky - The Steady Hand God Roll Is the Most Consistent Legendary Hand Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmdPE7KUrlQ)
* [DFP - THE STEADY HAND IS THE BEST 120 HAND CANNON!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--Pf0Uvpprg)
* [IFrostBolt - STEADYHAND = Run If You See This Hand Cannon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RVzmlxjq-I)
* [The Steady Hand UPDATED Review (The God Rolls)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne0XkYP3joU)

What I love about these videos (and this set of perks) is that there is not absolute agreement on which roll is the best.

Iron Banner weapons tend to shine in PvP, so we won't feature many PvE builds.
### The Steady Hand / PvP / Overview
With Bungie's announcement that they can now have different falloff tiers across Hand Cannons (see patch notes above) the 120s are, perhaps oddly, now able to compete with Pulse Rifles. That, plus the fact that this is a controller-centric wishlist, means we'll be favouring Stability and Aim Assist perks.

> *You don't really need to worry about Range in my opinion so much on these hand cannons since they already have so much to begin with. Not to say it isn't valuable, but I think that it might be worth boosting other aspects of this weapon."* - Drewsky
### The Steady Hand / PvP / Roll / **"Locked On"**
Moving Target and Iron Gaze are going to bump Target Acquisition immensely. You give up a few meters of damage falloff, and in return significantly increased accuracy.

### The Steady Hand / PvP / Roll / **"Demon of Sixes Street"**
This is primarily a roll for sixes where TSH can shine as a cleanup weapon with a higher chance of chaining kills. Keep in mind that a `Resilience` of `5` cancels out the Swashbuckler two-tap from full health but in sixes that's not always what you're dealing with. If you can pair this with a ranged melee (Swashbuckler x 5) you'llI wouldn't suggest this roll for Comp or Trials.

### The Steady Hand / PvP / Roll / **"Float Like a Butterfly"**
If you pair a Quickdraw TSH with a breach-load GL with a Quick Access Sling mod, you have a super powerful combination. Pairing it with Le Monarque has a similar effect: massive damage with an opening shot from your Energy weapon and a single shot from TSH to clean up. With Quickdraw and Snapshot, this Aggressive Frame can feel like a Lightweight.

### The Steady Hand / PvE / Overview
Generally in PvE you're going for as much `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. If you liked [The Duke Mk. 44](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2112909414/duke-mk-44/) then TSH could be for you.
### The Steady Hand / PvE / Roll / **"Rapid Reload"**
Without Outlaw, you're going to have to rely on Transversives, Marksman's Dodge, etc. to reload effectively in PvE. Without it, you're looking at a lot of downtime in situations where there are better alternatives. This is the case with Outlaw-based Duke rolls and people absolutely loved that sooo 🤷‍♂️

## Swarm of the Raven - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Swarm of the Raven** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1972985595/swarm-of-the-raven/)*


For a moment in time, Swarm of the Raven was a legit DPS option. It's a Void Grenade Launcher and the buff from Tractor Cannon made it a beast. It's not super hot anymore, but why not secure yourself a good one just in case? Chances are without even trying you're going to get a pretty decent roll. Enjoy!
* **(PvE) "Dive Bomb" 🦅🦅🦅🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: More impact damage and ammo reserves, along with bumped `Velocity`.

## Talons of the Eagle - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Talons of the Eagle** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1982711279/talons-of-the-eagle/)*


Talons of the Eagle is a 150 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Kinetic Scout Rifle. It originally appeared wayyy back in Season 4 (aka Forsaken). It's been recently re-issued in the first Season 11 Iron Banner. As part of this re-issue, the perk pool is unchanged, so we have years' worth of knowledge about how these work and years' worth of confusion as to why Scout Rifles can roll with `Threat Detector` and `Hip-Fire Grip`.

In order to beat out other long-range options in the Kinetic slot for PvP, I think you really want `Explosive Payload` here. 150s are the slowest-firing, heaviest-hitting scouts but when you're competing against snipers and Arbalests, I think you need more flinch than they can put out at base.

The general drawbacks of 150s is their low `Stability` and `Handling` so we're going to address those as a secondary focus in all in all of our rolls.
* **(PvP) "Planting Bombs" 🌿🌿🌿💣🌟Collector's Edition - 0.0% chance**: `Firmly Planted` is terrific on long-range weapons like Pulse and Scout Rifles where you can post up in cover and peek shoot from a distance. There's also not much else terrific in that slot. Zen Moment is good, but Firmly Planted outclasses it.

* **(PvP) "Raining Fire" 🌧🌧🌧🔥🌟Collector's Edition - 0.0% chance**: We're going to repeat the same set of rolls that we have above, minus `Firmly Planted` which is a pretty big playstyle preference that some folks are not super keen on. It's not a make-or-break here, so we're also going to feature rolls without it.

# The Forward Path
*For all possible perks, check out **The Forward Path** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/1690783811)*

The Forward Path is a 600 RPM (Adaptive Frame) Kinetic Auto Rifle, brought back to us in Season 11 Iron Banner. It was in the first batch of IB weapons that featured the new Iron Gaze and Iron Grip perks. 
### The Forward Path / PvP / Overview
The Forward Path, perhaps unsurprisingly given where it drops, is an absolute bear in PvP. 600 RPM ARs dominated the S11 meta and even though they were slightly reined in, they're still phenomenal. It has terrific base stats including the highest Aim Assist (71) of any Adaptive AR and is just an all-around terrific weapon.

A few interesting videos to consider:

* [Incoming Top-Tier Weapons! Prepare for GOD ROLLS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yizqbKsTbVY) - Fallout Plays
* [The Forward Path best perk combinations: It's GOOD!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnjCwCvf1UY) - CoolGuy
* [The Forward Path Review (97 Aim Assist & Iron Gaze/Grip Review)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMkJn9r6OC0) - Aztecross

TFP rolls with sights, not barrels, meaning that the appearance and effective range can be materially modified by your choice here.

* **25m**: Hitmark, Cleanshot
* **28m**: Red-Dot Micro, Red Dot 2 MOA
* **39m**: Rifle Scope ST, Rifle Scope SSF. One sticking point for some on these long-range scopes is the muzzle flash. The constrained view combined with muzzle flash can make target acquisition difficult. *"When you get down to 20m, tracking targets becomes an issue."* ([Aztecross](https://youtu.be/YMkJn9r6OC0?t=324))
### The Forward Path / PvP / Roll / **"Chasing Stability"**
`Tap the Trigger` starts you off stable and `Dynamic Sway Reduction` keeps you stable. `Iron Grip` is a crazy boost to `Stability`.
```
  Barrels [ 60%]: Red Dot Micro, Red Dot 2 MOA

### The Forward Path / PvP / Roll / **"Knock 'em Down"**
Don't underestimate the effect of MKC. Here's how it plays out:
* Base: 9 shots (8C, 1B) - 0.8s TTK // 14B 1.3s
* MKCx1: 7 shots (7C, 0B) - 0.6s TTK // 12B 1.1s

That's a pretty solid little boost; definitely spicy in sixes.

### The Forward Path / PvP / Roll / **"CoolGuy's Hybrid AR/SMG"**
Since damage falloff happens at 20m, you want these super zoomed out scopes and all the `Stability` and `Handling` we can get. We're only going to accept low-zoom scopes because you can only use this as close range and long-zoom scope won't have any use (and works against you).

### The Forward Path / PvE / Overview
If you're looking at The Forward Path from the perspective of a PvE player, you'll find a standard set of perks from seasons past. As Year 4 rolls on and more Kinetic weapons appear with sweet new perks like Surplus, Wellspring and One for All, TFP will find trouble shining. These are some workhorse rolls that will hold up until that point.
### The Forward Path / PvE / Roll / **"Robbin' and Bucklin'"**
Classic combo here. Grave Robber creates ammo to reload the mag and that melee kill will activate Swashbuckler x5.
```
  Barrels [ 60%]: Red Dot Micro, Red Dot 2 MOA

While Feeding Frenzy was slightly nerfed, it's still a terrific perk, activating (and stackin) on any kill. With two kills, you're at Outlaw level and with three kills you're beyond Outlaw.

# Code Duello
*For all possible perks, check out **Code Duello** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/2496242052)*

Code Duello is the Season 13 Rocket Launcher. You can pick it up from chests in the Battlegrounds playlists and Umbral Engrams. It features a handful of the new S13 perks including `Impulse Amplifier`, `Frenzy` and `Lasting Impression`. Ehroar put together a [solid video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcgBIemy83E) comparing them and offering some suggestions for interesting rolls. You're going to be drowning in these by the end of Season 13 and with the new damage perks, these are worth picking up!

Yes, you can finally get rid of the curated `Bad Omens` with `Impact Casing` you've been holding on to for ages 😉 A decent roll below is going to now outclass that because of the new final-column damage perks! 💥

Finally, definitely check out [Rustopholis]. He does super deep dives on Rocket Launchers, including a few that were super helpful in understanding how some of the new perks worked.

### Code Duello / PvP / Overview
Fallout has  [a guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iQSmF67Exk) hitting on `Blast Radius` and `Cluster Bombs` configuration for PvP and PvE. Of course, this was before the change was made that moved more of the damage away from the clusters. That being said, the overall thrust of the video still holds for PvP. For PvE with the release of the new damage perks, `Cluster Bombs` is no longer your pick (see below). 
### Code Duello / PvP / Roll / **"Rain Fire"**
First we start with a super high default `Blast Radius` of `95`. Then we sprinkle on some `Cluster Bomb` action and you've already got a great chance of splashing down on packs of Guardians. Add in high `Velocity` and improved `Handling` and you've got a snappy air raid in your grasp.
```
  Barrels [ 60%]: Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control

### Code Duello / PvE / Overview
Code Duello has some terrific new perks for dishing out major damage in a flexible way, one of which is incredibly interesting for folks soloing tough content. 
### Code Duello / PvE / Roll / **"One-Guardian Show"**
With `Lasting Impression` it's possible to stick a rocket, switch to another weapon and debuff the stickee (e.g. Divinity). With Auto- Loading Holster, by the time you switch back to Code Duello, it should be reloaded. Rinse and repeat! Be forewarned however, this is a super niche roll and not at all a run-and-gun RL. It's more for grins on what type of "chess" you can play with an RL in Destiny.

### Code Duello / PvE / Roll / **"Last Stand"**
This is your standard "stand behind cover / in a well and chuck rockets at the boss" roll. Whether or not you value `Frenzy` over `Lasting Impression` will depend on the encounter. The barrels and masterworks are mostly focused on adding Handling and are gravy (but solid if you get them!).

# Extraordinary Rendition
*For all possible perks, check out **Extraordinary Rendition** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/1097616550)*

Extraordinary Rendition is a 750 RPM Kinetic Submachine Gun; part of the S13 weapon set. Both perks and stats are [virtually identical](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BBbEym;BZzrdV) to the Cold Front, available only during the 2020 Dawning, so we'll be able to rely on the work we did there for these rolls 🎉🎉🎉 Ehroar covers the [Extraordinary Rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SplO6sE1Nxg) in depth.
### Extraordinary Rendition / PvP/PvE / Overview
The cornerstone of both PvE and PvP are `Surplus`. If you end up with a "PvE roll" that also happens to have super high Stability, then you've got the Holy Grail. Congrats! For an explanation of these rolls, please read further down towards the specific PvE and PvP sections.

### Extraordinary Rendition / PvP / Overview
EA needs a lot of help in the Stability department, which is the entire focus of these two rolls. At best, you'll be able to get Stability up from `17` to `52` plus the benefits coming from Surplus and Tap the Trigger. This puts you way above the base Stability on the vaunted Antiope-D and other Precision Frame SMGs. The Recoil is `97` so YMMV on whether or not a Counterbalance mod is required (I suggest an Icarus Mod otherwise).

### Extraordinary Rendition / PvE / Overview
With `Surplus`, `One for All` and `Frenzy` in the EA perk pool, we're looking at a strong contender for one of the best kinetic weapons of all time (second only to the Ikelos SMG). `Surplus` improves Stability and Reload and `One for All` and `Frenzy` provide a tremendous damage boost and leaves your mod slot free for Minor, Major or Boss Spec.
### Extraordinary Rendition / PvE / Roll / **"A Beautiful Rendition"**
This is going to be immensely helpful in **high tier content** where you aren't able to proc damage perks off of kills. While `Surplus` will be boosting Stability, the Stability is so low and difficult to manage on console that we'll continue to crave it as a backstop for when we're at lower tiers of `Surplus` benefits.

# Imperial Needle
*For all possible perks, check out **Imperial Needle** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/3460122497)*

The Needle is a Lightweight Frame, Void Bow, part of the S13 family of seasonal weapons. It can roll with many of the new perks including `Frenzy` and `Impulse Amplifier`. It's otherwise [quite similar](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=DOPUeB;Moe3e) to the Whispering Slab in terms of base stats.

As per usual, I suggest checking out these amazing posts:

* [A Bow Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrucibleSherpa/comments/kx1ew8/a_bow_guide/) - [/u/kfairns](https://www.reddit.com/user/kfairns/)

The new perks don't change the suggested PvP rolls from Whispering Slab, so these rolls will be straight reproductions from what we previously covered when S11 dropped; [Whispering Slab - S11](https://rslifka.github.io/wishlist/#whispering-slab).

## Berenger's Memory - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Berenger's Memory** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/407621213/berengers-memory/)*


Season 11 is the first time we've seen Berenger's Memory since Destiny 2 Year 1 (i.e. Season 1). It's the first time it's been available with random rolls. Grenade Launchers haven't been meta PvE DPS for some time, so why record wishlist rolls for this?

It's part of the Umbral Engram pool, and part of a focused roll with the IKELOS Sniper, so you're likely to be swimming in these just by doing the weekly evac quests by the end of S11. Chances are without even trying you're going to get a pretty decent roll.
* **(PvE) "Forgetful" 🤔🤔🤔🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.5% chance**: If you want a GL for sticking 'nades on a boss, this is the roll for you. All GLs are basically the same these days, so this set of rolls applies for Outrageous Fortune, Swarm of the Raven, etc.

## Cold Denial - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Cold Denial** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1216130969/cold-denial/)*


Cold Denial is a 340 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Kinetic Pulse Rifle introduced in Season 11. See [how it compares](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BIfK-Z;C-tvt8;BFN60K;MZyyP) to the existing High-Impacts. The major difference might seem like a minor one, but check out the `Zoom:14` compared to the others with `Zoom:18`. The lower zoom means you've got a wider FOV while zoomed in, and that small(er) thumbstick movements don't kick your reticle as much. It makes way more of a difference than it might seem like on paper.

Everyone is covering this Pulse Rifle because it's absolutely amazing. Check out [Drewksy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKTOCEijawI&feature=youtu.be&t=119), [Mtashed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtJeiwwGII0), and [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1jKsnDD6Ss) and I'm sure you'll see more coverage in the coming weeks as more folks get their hands on various rolls.

The headline perk here is `Killing Wind`. The decent Stability and low Zoom factor downplay the need for the only other alternative: `Zen Moment`. Check out CoolGuy's review of [Killing Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go1TYsXCopc&feature=youtu.be&t=420) Here's are the benefits as he describes them:

* `Killing Wind` has a five second duration. Additional kills refresh the duration.
* It adds roughly five tiers of Mobility with the attendant benefits (strafe speed, etc.).
* It adds roughly a 4m increase in damage falloff.
      
* The Range boost it provides "is like a sustained version of `Opening Shot`".
   
* Handling increase is on par with Snapshot and vastly improved stow speed.

The last column is interesting. A handful of perks elevate the roll but in my opinion, none are essential. Headseeker might seem strange but with the High-Impact buff in S11, it means a 4H2B kill instead of 5H2B on 6 resilience or less. Think about it as making your initial engagement  more forgiving whereas Multikill Clip and Swashbuckler make your follow-on engagements more forgiving.
* **(PvP) Verticality 🏔🏔🏔🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: You have to see Cold Denial with 100 `Recoil` and bumped up Stability to believe it. It will require that you use a Counterbalance mod, which is par for the course on Scattershot weapons (Autos, SMGs, etc.). It's completely vertical and barely moves during the burst. This roll even without the Stability MW, felt broken when I used it; really nuts.

There's not much to puzzle out here. In PvE you're going for as much `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. I think `Unrelenting` is a super interesting perk, I would just prefer to have the large damage bonuses active from damage-boosting perks.

## Falling Guillotine - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Falling Guillotine** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/614426548/falling-guillotine/)*


[Dark Drinker 2.0](https://youtu.be/W_ObIqaGhvM?t=305) is... sorry I mean Falling Guillotine... is a new "Vortex Frame" sword in S11. It does a [ridiculous](https://youtu.be/DxlrZnH7C1g?t=344) -  [amount](https://youtu.be/hWzifDFNww0?t=30) -  of -  [damage](https://youtu.be/SbBOCOJpMaE?t=103) and is also just [weird](https://youtu.be/YRcZ9IglcZM?t=31).

What makes this even better is that as with all other swords, the perk pool is super small, and with the Recaster perk `Umbral Enhancement III`, all of your Focused Umbral weapons get an additional final-column perk. As of this writing it appears to be bugged and I'm getting an extra final perk on unfocused drops 🤷‍♂️ (but also bugged in that I'm not getting a second perk on Cold Denial or Falling Guillotine 🤪) Chances are you'll get the roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll will keep you all the way through Season 14.

We're going for the classics here: Whirlwind and Surrounded. Maybe you'll get insanely lucky and get both Whirlwind and Surrounded as the perks in the final column?

*Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the case*
* **(PvE) Sustained DPS 🗡🗡🗡 🌟Collector's Edition - 2.7% chance**: With Whirlwind and Relentless you'll be slicing for what seems like forever. C/o [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/), Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed stat you won't notice the difference.

# False Promises
*For all possible perks, check out **False Promises** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/3143732432)*

False Promises is a 360 RPM Kinetic Auto Rifle introduced in Season 11. The High-Impacts are notable by their extremely long `Range` and extremely poor `Stability` and False Promises is no exception. On console, False Promises is pretty tough to control. Even with vertical `Recoil`, there's still a lot of bounce in the reticle because the `Stability` is so low.
### False Promises / PvP / Overview
I'm recommending, nay requiring `Dynamic Sway Reduction` for any False Promises roll I'd consider using in PvP, because of its marked affect on `Stability` and `Accuracy`. Here's what [Bungie had to say](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49126) about DSR prior to S11:

> **Dynamic Sway Reduction**: Adds 10 Stability over time in addition to accuracy (this is way more powerful than it sounds). Reduced reticle movement from Stability should now tell players this is working.

Here's a couple of videos examining Stability, including the effects of DSR. These were recorded before the aforementioned buff, so some of these may be a little out of date depending on which part of the content you're referring to.
* [Dynamic Sway Reduction on Auto Rifles & Zoom Effect | Destiny 2 Season of the Worthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S71_munFJYE)
* [Stability In Depth | Stat Review and Guide - The Heart of Destiny 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmQEFdjwzcw&feature=youtu.be)

All of the following rolls feature Eye of the Storm, Rampage and Swashbuckler. Think about this from a "forgiveness" perspective. If you want more forgiveness during your first exchange, choose Eye of the Storm. If you want more foregiveness during follow-on encounters, choose Rampage or Swashbuckler.

**Closing Remarks**: S11 continues the S10 600 RPM Auto Rifle meta. If you're planning on using an AR, I'd suggest any of the 600s kicking around, notably the Gnawing Hunger since it's so easily farmable via the Recaster. Alternatively, wait until The Summoner is up as the three-win reward in Trials and grab on there. As far as False Promises is concerned, I'll be holding on to a good PvP roll in the hopes that the sandbox is updated in S12 or beyond.
### False Promises / PvP / Roll / **"Stormfront"**
These 360s are primarily hampered by their ultra-low Stability, so we're going to do everything we can to correct it. `EotS` is part of that as it hones in progressively more as your health gets low. Be sure to swap in Counterbalance mod push the `Recoil` to `100`.

All Range and all damage, focused on Overflow and Subsistence.

## First In, Last Out - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **First In, Last Out** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3616586446/first-in-last-out/)*


"First In, Last Out" was released for the first time in Season 11 since its initial drop at the launch of Destiny 2 - Season 1! It's the first time we've seen this with random rolls, so it does have a contemporary set of perks available (e.g. Demoiltionist and Vorpal). Once the gear-pocalypse hits after Season 11 and everything is sunset, it will be the only slug shotgun in the game apart from Chaperone.

All that being said, it's a solid weapon with some solid rolls. Absolutely down the fairway for the sandbox and shotguns - grab some range and accuracy perks and you'll be all set. Slug shotguns have always been an acquired taste and nothing about filo changes that. It's not amazing, it's not terrible; it can do great work in the right hands.
* **(PvP) Aztecross' "Hip Shooter" 🕺🕺🕺🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: To quote my friend Lenny, "This is the kind of stupid idea I am fond of." [Aztec's contention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj1tNWkP9Fg) is that slug shotguns struggle because of high enemy mobility combined with having to zoom means a much tighter field of view that makes them even harder to track. This is precisely why I stop using Chaperone around 4000 Glory in Comp. Hunters with high mobility (the stat and the skill to do so) and charging shotgun rushers become nearly impossible to hit (for me at least!). This is a series of rolls based around Hip-Fire Grip and Opening Shot. It's a totally different way of playing and I love the idea of it! I doubt it will become meta, but this list is all about fun, specific rolls so here you go 😃

*For all possible perks, check out **First In, Last Out** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3616586446/first-in-last-out/)*


In the 5/21/2020 TWAB, Bungie announced a surprising buff to slug shotguns:
> Slug Shotguns are underused in PvE, because they require crits to maximize damage, and didn’t reward that precision with higher damage per second: `Slug Shotgun PvE Damage + 30%`.

With this buff, they hit much harder and are totally viable in low- to mid-tier PvE. In high-tier PvE you tend not to sidle up to enemies but that's not the fault of slug shotguns :)
* **(PvE) "First In, Never Out" 🥾🥾🥾🚪🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.4% chance**: All of the reloading options are interesting in their own way, so we have one general set of rolls revolving around `Assault Mag` and `Surrounded`.

## Hollow Words - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Hollow Words** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/607191995/hollow-words/)*


Hollow Words is a "Precision Frame" 740ms-charge-time Fusion Rifle released in Season 11. That means it shoots seven bolts and you need five of those to connect for a OHK.
Fusions have been my favourite special since Destiny 1. I have an Erentil with 1,082 kills on it 😱Currently fusions are not in a good place in the sandbox after a sweeping nerf that just went in. If you want the complete story, check out [CoolGuy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYhJU9NN_iU). TL;DW: Range is [compressed](https://youtu.be/CYhJU9NN_iU?t=350), perhaps moreso than hand cannons were. The end result is steep falloff after 17m for all types, quickly pushing you out of reasonable OHK range.

With the effect of bumping Range so negligible, you're only left with Stability and Handling to focus on. Higher Stability will result in less bolt spread as the burst completes, which is why we're going to focus on it. 

So why are we here? Why even bother with PvP rolls of a Precision Frame when only High-Impacts are worth pursuing? Two reasons: `Killing Wind` and `Disruption Break`. Combined, you've got great benefits.
* **If you get a final blow** then `Killing Wind` procs and you can begin [mapping Guardians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qfhrTicLbU) at Erentil-like ranges with your Hollow Words.
* **If you only break their shields** then `Disruption Break` activates and you can quickly swap to your primary and finish them off.

Without both of these perks, you may as well run a High-Impact Frame. I think it's possible to have Killing Wind and a bunch of Range perks, but you don't need a wishlist to tell you to take a single perk ;)
* **(PvP) Windbreaker 🧥🧥🧥🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.3% chance**: Let's bring in as much Stability as we can paired with our two superstar perks. I'm also willing to forego Stability in the barrel if it means having completely vertical recoil w/Arrowhead.

# IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2
*For all possible perks, check out **IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/2222560548)*

The IKELOS SMG 1.0.2 is an Aggressive Frame, Energy-slot 750 RPM SMG. With the advent of Warmind Cell mods, it has become a PvE staple.
### IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 / PvP / Overview
Back during the Warmind times (Season 3) its statically-rolled predecessor was a seriously legit part of the PvP meta. Apart from the original IKELOS SMG, in the history of Destiny 2, this archetype has had an unfortunate time of things. The only [other Aggressive Frames](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=CEeZUk;BZzrdV;GStUF;) have punishingly, unusably poor `Stability` so they never saw any play, not even on the fringes of the meta.

A few weeks into Season 11 an Bungie drops the new version of the IKELOS SMG, now called the IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 (compared to S3's V1.0.1). It now features random rolls with the new Y3 perks like Vorpal Weapon and Demolitionist. It also has a tremendous amount of Stability compared to its brethren, about triple.

* **`Seraph Rounds`**: The streamer~youtuberati are all abuzz about this perk. It has HCR built-in and does increased flinch! It increases Stability! It increases Range! One of those is correct - it does give a boost to damage falloff range. When I tested `Seraph Rounds` in the Tribute Hall, it pushed the range out by ~1m. Yep, a whole one meter. When I swapped in Accurized Rounds, it was basically the same, with a difference of less than a meter. I wouldn't  lose sleep about missing out on `Seraph Rounds`. Since this is a console wishlist and these Aggressive Frame SMGs have huge kick, we're going to prefer `Steady Rounds` and the attendant 38% increase in `Stability`.
* **`Threat Detector`**: The only evidence I've been able to find of how this perk works is present in this video: ["Threat Detector In Depth"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB7Fgvgchq8) which deduces a massive +20 to Stability at TDx1. The range for TDx1 is 14.8M (and below of course) which means a laser-like boost to Stability to where you could practically hip-fire the darn thing (no it does not drop with Hip-Fire Grip in its perk pool :)

Which set of rolls you go for depends on whether or not you want to keep your mod slot open for `Icarus Grip` or `Freehand Grip`. If you don't care for either of those, that's going to free up your choice of Barrels and you'll be able to throw a `Counterbalance Stock` mod in to fix the recoil.
### IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 / PvP / Roll / **"Rasputin's Choice; Mod Slot Free"**
Any time you see Dynamic Sway and Tap the Trigger available in both columns, that's a tough one to pass up. TtT keeps you steady on the initial burst and DSR keeps you steady afterwards. After that it's all `Stability`. This roll would push Stability from 39 to 74 (?!) and that's not including the additional Stability from DSR and TtT! With a Recoil-fixing Barrel, the mod slot is free for you.

### IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 / PvE / Overview
Ehroar thinks the IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 might be the [best PvE primary in Destiny 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sgVvsCK2BM) mostly because it can generate Warmind Cells and it has a great perk pool. He makes a strong case and with Reach, the nukes are nukey.

Note that the IKELOS_SMG also has `Disruption Break` will will proc when breaking a Barrier Champion's shield. However no other perks play off of it, so I won't feature a set of rolls here for it. Same goes for `Demolitionist` which is a great perk but doesn't overtly synergize with any of the other perks. As Ehroar points out, `Subsistence` wrecks the reserves on the IKELOS, by a whopping 44% (!) so I'm not recommending it as a perk.
### IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 / PvE / Roll / **"Seraph's Choice"**
Pair this roll with a `Surrounded Spec` mod and you are positively shredding through adds. Throw on a single Warmind Cell mod on to your armor and you become a nuclear bomb generating Guardian.

## IKELOS_SR_V1.0.2 - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **IKELOS_SR_V1.0.2** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1253087083/ikelos-sr-v102/)*


The IKELOS_SR_V1.0.2 is a 140 RPM Rapid-Fire Frame sniper. Stat-wise, the currently available batch are [mostly the same](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BKsJdr;o8g0X;DN5NWh;BLxysY) and unfortunately none can roll with both `Snapshot` and `Quickdraw` 😱 Note that the IKELOS does have a slightly higher Zoom (40 > 45) than half of the bunch. This may or may not work with your playstyle.

Let's get this out of the way - "What roll will replace my Beloved?" Unfortunately none of them. No 140 RPM sniper beyond the S11 power cap can roll like Beloved, Tatara Gaze, Apostate, etc. It looks like they're almost purposefully decoupling the great perks we're used to seeing together: Snapshot + Quickdraw, Snapshot + Opening Shot, etc.

Some thoughts on the perks I've selected:

* I value `Moving Target` over `No Distractions` for a few reasons. Contrary to the name, `Moving Target` procs [whether or not you're moving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcpJWC039m8). `No Distractions` takes 1.5-2s to activate. That is an eternity and basically unusable in Comp or Trials. Even when it does activate, `No Distractions` doesn't reduce flinch by that much. Here, check out [Fallout's testing](https://youtu.be/cUE4W03qPVY?t=171).
* `Seraph Rounds`, has just about every hidden benefit you can imagine ascribed to it. The only one I'm able to find definitive evidence for is that it increases range falloff by about 2m. When I compared it with `Accurized Rounds` on the IKELOS SMG, it pushed it about 1m further. That's the only reason I prefer it here, but they're basically the same in that one aspect. IMHO Bungie could definitely stand to redefine this perk if they're planning on keeping IKELOS weapons around.

There aren't a ton of great perks here, so I'm only featuring one roll with two variations: favouring `Handling` and favouring `Range`. 
* **(PvP) "Seraph Sharpshooter / Handling" 🎯🎯🎯🌟 Collector's Edition - 0.2% chance**: The IKELOS has `73` Aim Assist and with `Moving Target`, a `Targeting Adjuster` mod and `Enhanced Sniper Targeting` on your helm, you're plenty good on AA. Whatever tiny part of the `Range` stat affects AA is outweighed by faster Handling contributing to faster ADS and faster stow speed for cleanups.

Ehroar and Kackis both review the IKELOS 1.0.2 and land on similar reccomendations which I'll capture here. Ehroar's take is a little more thorough so I'm expanding the Collector's Edition with his thoughts.

## Temptation's Hook - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Temptation's Hook** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/35794111/temptations-hook/)*


Temptation's Hook is an absolutely EN FUEGO Season 11 sword that has all the perks you'd have to get separately from Honor's Edge, Steel Sybil, Stryker's Sure-Hand, etc. It's got Surrounded, Flash Counter, Whirlwind Blade... AND VORPAL WEAPON folks!

What makes this even better is that as with all other swords, the perk pool is super small, and with the Recaster perk `Umbral Enhancement III`, all of your Focused Umbral weapons get an additional final-column perk. As of this writing it appears to be bugged and I'm getting an extra final perk on unfocused drops 🤷‍♂️ (but also bugged in that I'm not getting a second perk on Cold Denial or Falling Guillotine 🤪)

* "Why no roll w/`Whirlwind`?" If you're going up against hordes of adds, you'll benefit best from Surrounded (see below). If you want to whack on a single target, then this sword isn't the choice; you want Falling Guillotine instead.
* `Surrounded` + `Surrounded Spec` ends up giving you a massive 36% damage increase ("only" 25% w/out Spec) and since a Sword is in-your-face there's a high chance you'll proc this regularly. Classically great perk on swords.
* `Flash Counter` not only disorients but  [applies a 20% debuff](https://youtu.be/b9HcFqLdlyQ?t=1477)! This means *all incoming damange* is upped by 20%. You can imagine how helpful this would be in Public Events (like the S11 Contact event), to debuff the boss with up to eleven other Guardians attacking. The debuff lasts for five seconds, so you'll need to periodically switch to blocking for this to take effect. Given that every boss in the game stomps, this is a great way to take out your anti-stomp rage 😡


Fortunately the perk set is very small and chances are you'll get the roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll will keep you all the way through Season 14.

*Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the case*
* **(PvE) Swiss Army 🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭 Collector's Edition - 2.1% chance**: Vorpal is a solid tool to have here. This roll won't do the most single-target damage against bosses, but that's not why you have it; you have it for the utility it brings. Being able to slice through adds **and** throw a heavy attack at a Champion or Boss is 😙 C/o [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/), Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed stat you won't notice the difference.

**🌟💥🎉 BOW HYPE TIME 🌟💥🎉 BOW HYPE TIME 🌟💥🎉 BOW HYPE TIME 🌟💥🎉**

Remember when we all thought Wish-Ender would break the Crucible because you could see through walls? That's the last time I thought bows might break the sandbox, or really even ever thought about using bows in PvP at all. Did you even know you can see through walls with Wish-Ender? I digress...

Many months ago, I saved a post by [/u/TheGuiltySpark117](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheGuiltySpark117) in the off chance I ever wanted to give bows a real shot in PvP. Over that time I've read and re-read it, every time I'm trying to figure out if I have a good bow roll. *I strongy suggest you check this out; it's phenomenal!*

[An In-Depth Guide to Using a Bow in Competitive PvP (Console or PC)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/hjvoka/an_indepth_guide_to_using_a_bow_in_competitive/)

I reached out to TheGuiltySpark117 who graciously wrote up thoughts and rolls for Whispering Slab. All of the content that follows is courtesy of TheGuiltySpark117. Plese head over to the [latest edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/fkgm0k/an_indepth_guide_to_using_a_bow_in_competitive/) of the guide and show your appreciation.

> I have two possible loadouts that I would consider a god roll for pvp. I don’t see a loadout for whispering slab that would be great for PvE, however.
### Whispering Slab / PvP / Overview
> You might’ve noticed that these aren’t specialized to the two types of playstyles I mention in my post. I did this on purpose because there are a much larger amount of players who aren’t bow mains, and care less about that kind of thing. These two are the best generalized god rolls that are tailored to the perspective of the majority. Both loadouts, however, are something that even I as a bow main in the crucible would be interested in acquiring.

> There are two versions of this bow that I would consider a god roll depending on two different play styles: one being `Aggressive`, and the other being more `Reserved`.
### Whispering Slab / PvP / Roll / **"GuiltySpark's Aggro Slab"**
Here's a breakdown of what we're going for:


  * `Elastic String`: Sacrifices accuracy to increase draw speed,
    meaning you can pull it back and fire it faster. Aka, lowers ttk
    for the weapon by a small fraction. With this loadout we're not
    too concerned about accuracy as engagements will be at closer
    ranges.
  * `Fiberglass Arrow Shaft`: Lowers stability, which is not
    concerning for a bow, but increases accuracy considerably. This is
    the best type of arrow any bow can have because there are no
    noticeable drawbacks of having it.
  * `Killing Wind`: Adds five tiers of movement speed to your guardian
    when the trait is active, meaning you will feel much quicker and
    lighter, allowing you to play more aggressively.
  * `Unrelenting`: Rewards an aggressive playstyle by granting a small
    amount of health on top of triggering health regeneration. In the
    Crucible, every other guardian kill will trigger this trait.
    Triggering this trait means you'll have less downtime between
    engagements, and you'll have some room to perform interesting
    plays in 1v2/3 or more scenarios.
  * `Accuracy Masterwork`: This helps conteract the reduction in
    accuracy that Elastic string has, making the bow feel a little
    more reliable when shooting.

### Whispering Slab / PvP / Roll / **"GuiltySpark's Reserved Slab"**
The objective of this loadout is to max it's Accuracy as high as it can go, so that the player can use it at longer distances and not feel forced to engage at closer ranges.

  * `High Tension String`: We're going for max accuracy with this
    loadout.
  * `Fiberglass Arrow Shaft`: Again, the best Arrow type for any bow.
  * `Archer's Tempo`: High Tension String gives an increase to draw
    speed, and Archer's Tempo will act to negate its effects while
    still lowering Draw Time to a reasonable degree.
  * `Opening Shot`: Further increases Accuracy and bullet magnetism to
    the head, making the bow more reliable at longer distances.
  * `Accuracy Masterwork`: Again, going for as high of an Accuracy
    stat as we can.

## Seventh Seraph Carbine - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph Carbine** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1561006927/seventh-seraph-carbine/)*


The Seventh Seraph Carbine (SSC) is a 450 RPM "Precision Frame" Kinetic Auto Rifle. Let's start with a quick comparison to randomly-rolled 450s, over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BdCxNP;mJ1-6;Bqp0Wx;Fju9i;DmTiv3). In general the 450s are fairly the same stat-wise, with a material deviation in Aim Assist for the SSC; easily addressable with an Aim Assist mod. 

Should you pick one up for use in Season 10? In Season 10, 600 RPM "Adaptive Frame" Auto Rifles are the meta (e.g. SUROS Regime, Monte Carlo, Hard Light). There's no pressing reason to chase SSC rolls for PvP.

I personally love ARs, so I played with a [zero-Recoil, high Stability](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/DY2Aqw8sOokyOvhv0Wv1Ehw9zBP2FwQRxW2Ig9KX1MIo3LEpW) roll for several Iron Banner games, with both Enhanced Targeting and Enhanced Unflinching. I immediately wanted to go back to using my Arc Logic with Moving Target and Tap the Trigger :) The SSC is definitely a bit slower than you'd prefer (as are all 450 RPMs, even the vaunted Uriel's Gift these days). 

That being said, if you enjoy Destiny's National Pasttime of shredding supers in sixes, a Vorpal-rolled SSC could be for you! If you're a fan of ARs or even just the SSC itself, why not pick one up and vault it just in case the meta changes? Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* The lower the RPM the higher the range, and falloff for a base range SSC starts ~30m which is quite far in-game; probably at the maximum range you'd choose to engage with an Auto Rifle anyway.
* I'm passing on `Threat Detector` because at that engagement range of 15m, you're going to feel like switching to your special weapon.
* With a base `Recoil` of `74`, you're fine there. I shot a few magazines into a wall with `100` and the pattern was the same. Do not put on a `Counterbalance` mod or else you'll ruin the recoil pattern. 
* I don't have any rolls featuring `Elemental Capacitor` because at some point you hit diminishing returns on all this `Stability`. I pivot around `Moving Target` because it's not something that many Auto Rifles can roll and it makes it far more lethal by directly addressing target acquisition.

Here's a few rolls worth considering that you can put to work today!
* **(PvP) Slif's "Pristine, Picture-Perfect Auto Rifle" 🧼📸 Collector's Edition - 0.0% chance**: This is my pristine, picture-perfect Auto Rifle roll. There's less than a 0.1% chance you get this, so if you do please buy us both a lottery ticket.

*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph Carbine** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1561006927/seventh-seraph-carbine/)*


For its base stats and perks, there isn't a whole lot of reason to consider the SSC for PvE. While it does feature Swashbuckler and Rampage, it doesn't combine it with a reload-boosting perk like Feeding Frenzy or Outlaw. Breakneck, the Gambit Pinnacle weapon with the unique perk `Onslaught` is also 450 RPM and recently received a buff in Season 10. It shreds in PvE and since it's a Legendary weapon, it can take the Season 10 Artifact mods.
Still, there's at least a couple of reasons why you might want to consider a SSC.
1. It's a Seraph weapon! If you're running Warmind mods on your armor, Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.
1. It can roll with `Fourth Time's the Charm` and `Vorpal` together, which activates on Champions and in the current Season 10, Auto Rifles can take Overload mods. In the future things will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier too. The mag seems endless when dumping in to Champions and bosses; kinda cool :)
* **(PvE) Slif's "Butter and Citrus Bar Shredder" 🧈🍊 - 2.8% chance**: This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE content. FTTC and Vorpal make the roll; without both you may as well use another Vorpal weapon. Based on the past two seasons, they won't be hard to come by :)

## Seventh Seraph CQC-12 - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph CQC-12** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1821724780/seventh-seraph-cqc-12/)*


The CQC-12 is an 80 RPM "Lightweight Frame" shotgun in the energy slot. Through leveling the season pass, you unlock a chance for it to drop at the conclusion of Gambit, Crucible and Strike activities. You can't really "farm" it per se. The good news is that there's only four perks in the final two columns meaning it's not incredibly difficult to get the perks you might be interested in. See how it compares to other randomly-rolled 80 RPMs over on  [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BslVBs;CEKlVP;Brud8B;DmKQYw). Statistically, they're all quite similar and like all shotguns, otherwise identical in barrels and magazines.

Three reasons why the CQC is exciting for PvP:

* Where the CQC-12 stands out from its kin is that it can roll with the vaunted Quickdraw + Snapshot pairing. No other 80 RPM shotgun can do this. Here's  [the list](https://www.light.gg/god-roll/?f=2,10\(Shotgun\),28:0\(706527188;957782887\)) of shotguns that can. Perhaps as a drawback however, it cannot roll with Opening Shot or Moving Target.
* It can roll with Vorpal which means it can two-shot any super in PvP. If you'd like a little footage of DFP slaying with Vorpal (and an otherwise) near perfect roll, [here you go](https://youtu.be/30b4t1XZdi0?t=110).
* It looks and sounds *amazing*, and that's like 80% of the reason to use a weapon :)

Our first couple of roll sets will be classic shotgun rolls and the third will feature Vorpal; currently the only shotgun that can roll it!

This section will be straightforward :) All of our rolls are toing to be centered around Trench Barrel. It provides a 50% damage boost vs. Vorpal's 15%. Trench Barrel takes a melee to activate, but with shotguns you have to be in melee range anyway, so you're good!

This isn't a "run and gun" shotgun. There are no damage-boosting perks, like Swashbuckler or Rampage, you have Slideshot and Auto-Loading Holster but so do plenty of other shotguns.
* **(PvE) Slif's "Butter and Citrus Bar Shredder" 🧈🍊Collector's Edition - 1.3% chance**: We're basing these next few rolls around Trench Barrel. Quickdraw will help with swapping from the hits between Trench Barrel activations.

## Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3037520408/seventh-seraph-officer-revolver/)*


The Officer Revolver is a 180 RPM Kinetic Hand Cannon. See how it compares to other 180 RPM Hand Cannons over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=C1DOIY;xtxS0;DzBRNi) Let's start off with Mercules and Kyt from the latest Massive Breakdown podcast. Turns out they [aren't super hot](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-156-seventh-seraph-weapons-breakdown#t=33:44) on the Officer's Revolver.

> **Mercules:** *"Noticably worse than every other Precision hand cannon except for Trust, which has better Aim Assist and Recoil then the Officer's. Statistically, Officer's is not a super impressive hand cannon."*

Personally I think that's overstating things. The Service Revolver isn't **that** much different in terms of base stats. Trust is clearly better but not insanely-so. That being said, it's a 180 and the 180s haven't been part of the PvP meta in quite a while. If they were any stonger they'd be three-tapping and that would make them far too strong. I agree with Mercules' position that given how easy they are to use, they have a balanced TTK.


Now let's check out [Drewsky's thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3kCNDYUnzM), who finds the novel perks like Firmly Planted and Timed Payload worth strong consideration. Notably, he had previously [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IevtKKR_YxM) wishing for more Hand Cannons to have Firmly Planted.
> **Drewsky:** *"I think this is actually a pretty competitive group of stats especially compared to a lot of the other 180 RPM hand cannons. What makes it special is that it has a group of pretty competitive stats; maybe not the best stats but maybe the best perk pool in combination with those stats available on a 180."*

Vorpal and Timed Payload are uniquely available on the Officer Revolver. I personally love Vorpal in PvP and love the idea of Timed Payload, but I've always liked variety more than than the objective, optimal meta. If that partially describes you and you're interested in bagging a few PvP rolls, read on!
> **Drewsky:** *"Prioritizing Range while giving the best oveall stat package possible."*

I only partially agree with Drewsky here. Going back to our understanding of the new compressed range on Hand Cannons, we can cite some science from CoolGuy: "(35 Range = 25m falloff, 86 Range = 28m)". I'm not sure I'd want to blow valuable Magazine and Barrel slots for one to three meters of falloff.

The good news is that the wishlist can support multiple perspectives! I'll put together a set of Range-prioritizing rolls representing Drewsky's perspective, and a set of Handling/Stability prioritizing rolls. There is no "baseline" roll for the Officer Revolver because the baseline stats aren't what make this weapon interesting. There are plenty of other 140s and 150s that you'd prioritize over this if you were just looking for a workhorse PvP Hand Cannon.
* **(PvP) Drewsky's "Planted Range" 🏔🌱🏔🌱🏔🌱Collector's Edition - 0.1% chance**: *"Timed Payload?! That's supposed to be positively horrible. Doesn't it lower your TTK?"* Well, it causes double the flinch and the explosion has no range falloff. On a 180 RPM Hand Cannon, Timed Payload shouldn't lower the TTK (Drewsky didn't have one on hand to verify the math) as you would be getting the kill on the last bullet and not on the last 17 damage from Timed Payload. Vorpal is great for shredding supers.

## Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3037520408/seventh-seraph-officer-revolver/)*


There are so many great Hand Cannons for general purpose add shredding that you can skip the Officer's Revolver if you don't feel like adding another one to your vault. Personally I had a perfectly rolled Service Revolver (Rapid-Hit + Kill Clip) and never used it because it couldn't one-tap red bar adds - a 140 or 150 with Kill Clip ends up being my preferred.

"OK Slif, so why do you even have a PvE section here?"
1. Most importantly, it's a Seraph weapon! If you're running Warmind mods on your armor, Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.
1. It can roll with Vorpal, which activates on Champions and in the current Season 10, Hand Cannons can take Overload and Unstoppable mods (and in the future will rotate back around to take Anti-Barrier mods I'm sure).

"Whatevs, I've never been a fan of Vorpal and I don't really care about the seasonal stuff" - all good, stop reading and farm something else! It can also roll with Osmosis but with how great Hard Light and Borealis are, I can't imagine preparing for a difficult Strike or Nightmare Hunt and saying "Oh let me grab my Officer's Revolver with Osmosis to help us out!" 😉
* **(PvE) Slif's "Butter and Citrus Bar Shredder" 🧈🍊 - 2.8% chance**: This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE content. We don't need to be any more specific here; the other columns and Masterwork aren't deal-breakers or roll-makers. By itself, Vorpal isn't strong enough to recommend this over other Kinetics. **WARNING**: It's possible that a PvP roll without a preference in the FTTC column will "take" this roll. Bear in mind that might have this roll and it would be lit up as a PvP roll.

## Seventh Seraph SAW - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph SAW** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2582755344/seventh-seraph-saw/)*


Drewsky has a great review of the [Bane of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hqmrV1pk0), another 360 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Machine Gun. From the review, it hits for 48 crit / 38 body (TTK 0.5s / 0.83s). It's got terrific range and flinches like crazy.

That being said, it's still a Machine Gun which tends not to be the pick for PvP... BUT... BUT! The SAW can roll with `Opening Shot` in the final column. Because the rate of fire is so low, you can single tap out shots and get crits across the map. Try out some Machine Gun sniping in Mayhem and let me know how that works out for you 🎯

Otherwise, there's no pressing reason to farm for a SAW for PvP, at least none moreso than any other Machine Gun.
* **(PvP) Slif's "Sniper MG" 🎯 Collector's Edition - 0.5% chance**: Any basic roll will chew up Guardians with a lot of flinch. Let's add `Range` and `Stability` where we can, while seeing what `Opening Shot` can do.

## Seventh Seraph SAW - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph SAW** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2582755344/seventh-seraph-saw/)*


The SAW is 360 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Machine Gun and is an absolute monster in PvE. *"But Slif, everyone says Machine Guns are crap for DPS so why do you even have a PvE section?!?"*

Walk with me, grasshopper.

This is going to be a long one because I haven't found any super detailed coverage of the SAW (or any other Seraph weapon save for the Hand Cannon). Fortunately since a High-Impact is a High-Impact (at base), Drewsky has a great review of the [Bane of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hqmrV1pk0) that's definitely worth watching! The SAW can't roll with most of the perks he discussed in that video, but it's still super solid at its base.

* It's a Seraph weapon which means it generates Warmind Cells if you have Warmind mods equipped (Season 10).
* As a High-Impact Frame, the SAW keeps anything it doesn't kill practically stun-locked. As the difficulty of PvE content increases, this becomes super important. Even if you're not doing Grandmaster Nightfalls, flinching challenging adds sure makes things more straightforward. Keeping the bosses flinched as they march towards your plate during a Seraph Tower event comes in handy!
* Its base effecive `Range` is amazing. Damage falloff starts ~45m and is reasonable up to ~50m (-5%). You're talking maximum damage at Scout Rifle ranges. At maximum range, the sight overlaps your target because MGs don't have high-zoom sights/scopes. *This is why I'm not suggesting any `Range` boosting below - when I pushed the `Range` to `93` falloff and floors were unchanged and the recoil/handling will make it challenging to stay on target anyway.*
* It's the only Machine Gun that can roll with `Vorpal` or `Firing Line` in the final column, which provide 15% and 25% damage boosts, respectively. Those are substantial increases to damage without requiring a kill or reload to activate. 

If you're still not bought in, that's cool 😀👋. If you're still here, let's get those rolls! In order of importance:

* Column 3:
  * ✅`Field Prep` is far and away the winner. It grants a whopping 25%
  more in reserve (223 to 278), speeds up your reload time by two seconds
  (~5.5s to ~3.5s) and increases ready and stow speed. For PvE, nothing
  else comes close. By the way, within 45m at 1,222 to 1,716 damage,
  that's an extra 67k - 94k damage available to you.

  * ❌`Auto-Loading Holster` and `Grave Robber` are the other two reload
  perks in this column and neither is worth giving up the reserve and
  handling bonuses that `Field Prep` provides.

* Column 4:
  * ✅`Firing Line`: 25% damage boost when near two teammates. In
PvE content you're nearly always with your fireteam: Strikes, Raids, Menagerie, Vex Offensive, Sundial, Seraph Towers... I'm comfortable reccomending `Firing Line` in general. It has double utility in dealing with adds and on boss DPS. Granted it's not your go-to for boss damage but since you already have it equipped for adds and Champions, may as well have something to do with all this ammo when you're on the boss!

  * ✅`Vorpal`: 15% damage boost to yellow bars and Champions. It's
a solid pick if you don't have one with `Firing Line`.

  * ❌`Mulligan`: Nope. You shouldn't be missing many shots and the
opportunity cost of Mulligan is too high. At maximum range on the Tribute Hall Ogre, I was hitting at least 50% crits at the base `Recoil` and no `Stability` boosts.

  * ❌`Opening Shot`: This is interesting because at 360 RPM you can tap
out one bullet at a time, turning this in to kind of an incredibly high-impact Scout Rifle. Situationally cool but you can still use the SAW like this just fine without it. Arguably more of an off-meta PvP pick.

  * ❌`Elemental Capacitor`: While large, the effect of any of these
increases pales in comparison to significantly higher damage output. You can also get each of the benefits through other perks or armor mods. This isn't a case in general against `Capacitor`, just on this particular weapon.

  * ❌`Disruption Break`: A 50% Kinetic damage bonus debuff is nothing to
sneeze at! This is a niche pick for when you're up against Arc shields because in a Match Game activity, you won't do enough damage to break non-matching shields. Myself, if I'm hopping in to a difficult PvE activity I'm going to get more general, always-on use from Firing Line.
Otherwise we're shooing for higher Stability
* **(PvE) Slif's "Together Forever" 🤝♬ Collector's Edition - 0.6% chance**: With other Guardians at your side, you will rip through hordes of aliens no problem. We're taking any Barrel that increases Stability and magazine-extended... Magazines. Extended Magazine would normally be a hot mess with a base `Reload` so low, but with Field Prep it only takes the reload from ~3.5s to ~4.5s (still 1s shorter than the base `Reload`).

# Seventh Seraph SI-2
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph SI-2** over on [d2gunsmith.com](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/3937866388)*

The SI-2 is the 2020 version of the Anonymous Autumn (Kyt: *"which is the best-in-class for lightweight sidearms"*) and is the only other randomly rolled 360 RPM Energy sidearm. Mercules is on the same page: *"It (SI-2) doesn't have great Stability or great Range. I would pick a well-rolled Anonymous Autumn over this every time."* Why do they say that? It's got basically the same stats as an Anonymous Autumn but has 33% less Range and 20% less Stability. On the plus side the SI-2 has 7% better Handling (64 > 69) 🙃
### Seventh Seraph SI-2 / PvP / Overview
TrueVanguard, who absolutely loves the Anonymous Autumn (with over 14,000 kills) depicts the SI-2 as situational, relying primarily on Vorpal to justify using it. Check out [his thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCtP2PjAEgY).

If you are going to consider the SI-2 for PvP, a few things to keep in mind:
* The recoil direction is 95, so no need to worry about straightening it out. I.e. the +Recoil barrels shouldn't be your first pick. Instead, focus on Range and Stability.
* Full Auto is going to be a make-or-break perk for some, as many guardians have a love-it-or-hate-it relationsihp with single-shot sidearms. If that's your thing, know that no other perk in that column is a must-have. I find that 360s are unsuable for me without it, so I'll be picking one of these up to see how it plays with Vorpal.
### Seventh Seraph SI-2 / PvP / Roll / **"Full Auto Super Shredder"**
These rolls aren't super tight on the Barrel and Magazine front because they aren't going to dramatically alter the value of the overall roll. Vorpal is really the key here. Without Vorpal, you're better off using the better-rolled Anonymous Autumn as mentioned above. Otherwise we're going for +Range and +Stability wherever we can get it.

### Seventh Seraph SI-2 / PvE / Overview
Like all other Seraph weapons, the SI-2 contributes to the generation of Warmind cells in PvE. If that's not your thing, you can pretty much pass on this weapon full stop. Since it can roll with Dragonfly, it could have made beautiful music with the `Wrath of Rasputin` Warmind mod: `Solar splash damage final blows have a chance to create Warmind Cells`. Unfortunately the SI-2 is a Void weapon 👿

That being said, there are a few combos that could prove interesting for the discerning collector / sidearm aficionado.
### Seventh Seraph SI-2 / PvE / Roll / **"Sparks Flying"**
The SI-2 is the only sidearm in the game that can roll with both Demolitionist and Dragonfly. That's exciting because Demolitionist counts the Dragonfly collateral kills towards getting your grenade back. Don't forget the `Dragonfly Spec` mod from Ada-1!

### Seventh Seraph SI-2 / PvE / Roll / **"You're Trapped In Here With Me"**
Like Grave Robber and Swashbuckler, these two perks play super well off each other. If you love sidearms, considering adding this to your collection. You'll do some serious damage during Seraph Tower events.

## Seventh Seraph VY-7 - PvP
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph VY-7** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/766323545/seventh-seraph-vy-7/)*


The VY-7 is a 600 RPM Energy "Precision Frame" SMG. Here's how it compares to all other randomly-rolled 600 RPM SMGs on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=trStZ;CYr9QP;CQZu7f;B9hF8b;). It's competitive base-stat-wise but there's a reason you've probably never been killed by any of these weapons (or any SMG for that matter) since the first year of Destiny 2. In Season 10 with the recent Adaptive Auto Rifle buff, Auto Rifles outclass SMGs and failing ARs, both sidearms and shotguns are going to frustrate the hell out of you.

Forget it right? But do you remember this world?

* [Antiope-D and Sniping = New Meta ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjG32gyUh_w) - ZkMushroom

The VY-7 is an Energy Antiope-D (the basic stat variances are immaterial in practice). Yes it's not the meta now, but a solid roll might be worth throwing in the vault.

"Why don't any of these rolls value `Range`?" The difference between the base range of `59` and let's say `80` (using Accurized Rounds, etc.) buys you about a whopping one meter of falloff (~16 to ~17m). I don't value buffing Range all that highly on the VY-7. It's not that it's *bad* per se, it's just that the opportunity cost is high.
* **(PvP) Slif's "Weird Auto Rifle but OK" 🤷‍♂️🌱 Collector's Edition - 0.7% chance**: We're going to use a Counterbalance Mod to get the Recoil to 100, so we can go for Stability-enhancing Barrel options. Wait, what the hell is `Elemental Capacitor` doing in there?! The Handling and Stability bonuses are material. The Stability bonus is the most noticeable,  [estimated](https://youtu.be/D_Mv-AdfYqM?t=36) to be around `20 points`. You *absolutely* feel the difference with `Elemental Capacitor` active (don't forget to swap weapons if you're testing it) so I won't be relaxing it on these rolls. I think there's not much of a point to this SMG above other Energy weapons unless you can flex what makes it unique, and `Elemental Capacitor` certainly does that.

## Seventh Seraph VY-7 - PvE
*For all possible perks, check out **Seventh Seraph VY-7** over on [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/766323545/seventh-seraph-vy-7/)*


The VY-7 is the only SMG that's able to roll with Vorpal and you'll want one of these for two reasons:

* The VY-7 is a Seraph weapon and contributes to the generation of Warmind Cells.
* SMGs are eligible for certain Season 10 Artifact weapon mods.

...so let's come up with some rolls that help shred Champions and generate Warmind Cells (i.e. shred adds).

You must absolutely run a `Counterbalance` Mod or otherwise fix the Recoil with `Arrowhead Brake` or `Chambered Compensator`. Even though its base Recoil is `91` it's still a hot mess to control, esp. with its low Handling. For the rolls below I'm going to assume you're rolling with a `Counterbalance` Mod installed.
* **(PvE) "Champion Shredder" 🏆💥 Collector's Edition - 0.7% chance**: Whenever SMGs are up on the Artifact, you'll want Vorpal to help shred through Champions. FTTC might seem like a strange choice for an SMG but the rate of fire is so fast, you'd be surprised how often it you end up getting it to proc. I won't be relaxing either Vorpal or FTTC on these rolls because just one of either would mean that it's not worth using this over something else in the Energy slot.
