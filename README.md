# Welcome!
Did I Strike Gold? Or Lead? This is what I'm hoping to do with my wishlist. It's not trying to tell you every possible perk that might happen to be good, it's trying to tell you when a set of related perks came together to make an interesting roll.

I tend to play a bit off-meta (well, a lot if you ask my fireteam!) so my goal with these lists is to help me decide what rolls of weapons (even if they aren't "the meta") would be interesting to use in both PvE and PvP. I'll strive to include as much color in the notes of each weapon as I can. These are visible when clicking on a suggested roll in DIM. As the wishlist is updated, so are the thoughts that go in to each set of rolls, which you can find a link to above.

**This is a console-centric wishlist.** If you're on PC, generally you have a Range preference over Stability. Keep that in mind when you see something with a suggested Stability-related perk or a Stability Masterwork.

# Who Made This?
I've been playing Destiny since the Alpha with just shy of 3,300 hours played as of February 2019. That's how everyone starts out one of these right? :) Well, I captured the rolls so ultimately I'm responsible for them but all of the creators listed below influenced every single one of these rolls in one or two ways:

1. **Directly**: They reviewed a weapon and shared specific insights as to why and how a particular roll could be effective.
2. **Indirectly**: They published content about how the sandbox itself functions (i.e. how perks work, what the core attributes are)
  
I quote and link to sources per-weapon in the [Roll Guide](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/blob/master/thought_process.md). Go check out these Destiny scientists and the content they produce. Really amazing stuff. Every roll of every weapon was influenced in some way by their work.
