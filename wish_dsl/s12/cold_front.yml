  Cold Front is a 750 RPM Aggressive Frame ("High damage, high recoil") Kinetic
  Submachine Gun, first introduced long ago during the Season 9 Dawning event.
  It's back once again with a whole new set of perks from Year 4. If you want to
  see the old perks, here's a still from

  Ehroar and co. are excited because Cold Front can roll with the new
  damage-boosting perk `One for All` which we'll get to down in the PvE section
  below.


  They're each referring to PvE above, so Crucible dwellers don't get your hopes
  up too high! It's still the same nearly-lowest-Stability-in-the-game Cold
  Front that it was last year, though the new version does have a few tricks up
  its sleeve...

    overview: >
      If you remember the Cold Front from last year, you'll recall its
      Stability is one of the lowest in the game at `16`. Technically that's
      "better" than Hard Truth's `15` though not by much. This is less of an
      issue on PC than Console, though it's still an issue. However, this time
      around we have two new tools at our disposal: `Surplus` and `Dynamic Sway
      Reduction`.


      You'll notice I didn't include any final column perks. Rampage doesn't
      meaningfully realistically alter the TTK and Thresh adds so little to
      your super that it's not worth calling out as the Collector's Edition.
      Whatever you get in that final column is fine.

        overview: >
          Cold Front needs a lot of help in the Stability department, which is
          the entire focus of this roll. At best, you'll be able to get
          Stability up from `16` to `48` plus the benefits coming from Surplus.
          This puts you at or above base Stability on the vaunted Antiope-D and
          other Precision Frame SMGs. The Recoil is `92` so be sure to throw on
          a Counterbalance mod if you don't end up with a +Recoil barrel.

          Same as the above, swapping DSR in for Surplus. These rolls are otherwise
          identical but Surplus is so much better than DSR I wanted to call it out 😀

    name: PvE
    overview: >
      With the addition of `Surplus` and `One for All` to the Cold Front perk
      pool, we're looking at a strong contender for one of the best kinetic
      weapons of all time. `Surplus` improves Stability and Reload (two big Cold
      Front drawbacks) and `One for All` provides a tremendous damage boost
      and leaves your mod slot free for Minor, Major or Boss Spec.


      ***`Dragonfly` is going to be replaced by `Swashbuckler` so when you
      see `Dragonfly` below, you know what it means. The wishlist will be
      updated after Destiny is updated.***

        overview: >
          While `Surplus` will be boosting Stability, the Stability is so low
          and difficult to manage on console that we'll continue to crave it as
          a backstop for when we're at lower tiers of `Surplus` benefits.
