    summary: >
      The BrayTech Werewolf is a 450 RPM "Precision Frame" Kinetic Auto Rifle
      first introduced in Season 8. It's now available in the 2020
      [Festival of the Lost](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/Events/FestivalOfTheLost)
      event, with random rolls. The only competitive AR archetype right now are
      the 600s, so you're gambling on an eventual sandbox change for this to be
      more effective in PvP.
      
      
      Obtaining this Auto Rifle is a pretty grim affair, behind three levels of
      RNG:

      1. You need Cipher Decoders to drop, which they **have a chance of**
      doing do at the end of most activities (Ordeal, Strike playlist,
      Crucible, etc.).

      1. You need the Werewolf to drop from a Haunted Forest chest. The chance
      appears to be something between "never" and "20%" with most folks
      reporting closer to 5-10%. There's a thread on
      [/r/DestinyTheGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/jaeitx/horror_story_werewolf_drop_rate_is_2025_chasing/)
      about it.

      1. You need to get the roll you're chasing.
      
      
      While you are more than welcome to run and grind for these, keep in mind
      that once you obtain a single drop, you can pull a very good PvE static
      roll from your collections. Given that 450 RPM ARs haven't been
      competitive in PvP since Year 1 of Destiny 2, you're prrrobably not
      missing on much.

          With completely vertical recoil and loads of Stability, this will be
          an absolutely shredder should 450s get a buff. Hell and even if they
          don't, you'll do pretty decent work with it. All rolls in this set
          will feature `Dynamic Sway Reduction` and `Tap the Trigger`.

          Same set of rolls as above, but swappig out `Eye of the Storm` for
          `Tap the Trigger`. You definiely want `Tap the Trigger` but EotS is
          also legit.
