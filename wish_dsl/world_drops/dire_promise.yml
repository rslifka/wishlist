overview: >
  The Dire Promise is a 140 RPM
  Hand Cannon that was re-issued all the way back in Season 10 and much has
  changed. Sunsetting was introduced and then rolled back, 150 RPM HCs were
  collapsed into the 140 RPM frames and 110 RPMs were upgraded to 120 RPM,
  turning them into abosolute PvP monsters.
  

  Here we are in Season 13 and it's March 2021. Today, there are only two 140
  RPM HCs in the game - Dire Promise (Kinetic) and Palindrome (Energy,
  Nightfall-Exclusive). Sounds crazy right? Check out

    overview: >
      With the collapse of 150s > 140s and 110s > 120s, the 140 RPM subtype
      needs a bit of help. It doesn't have the range of the 120s or the 
      flinch factor and ease of use of the 180s. Dire Promise is also on
      the perk pool of Season 10. You have a middling subtype on an old perk
      pool; what's not to like? 🙃

          140s crave Stability. They won't be helped as much by Range as they
          are by what Stability gives you: an AA cone that resets more quickly
          than it would otherwise and less kick to correct for.

    name: PvE
    overview: >
      Dire Promise is hampered in PvE by having only the old perk pool
      available. It's likely not your choice for high(er) tier PvE content
      because of that.

          Relying on old reliable perk pairings, this will do work for you
          in low to mid tier PvE content.
