    summary: >
      Stars in Shadow is a 340 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Energy Pulse Rifle
      introduced in Destiny 2 Year 4 (Beyond Light). See
      [how it compares](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=B6PI-k;BIfK-Z;BFN60K;)
      to the existing High-Impacts that lit up in Season 11. 


      People are loving SiS because it's a solid Pulse Rifle with good base
      stats, a clean sight and a great feel. I'm sure you'll see more coverage
      in the coming weeks as people settle in to Beyond Light and Season 12.


      These rolls are going to be similar to those we captured in our
      coverage of
      [Cold Denial](#cold-denial---pvp)
      as it's a comparable 340 RPM. All of the rolls are similar save for the
      final column perks, so we're going to combine them in a single roll rather
      than repeat them all.


      There are two new perks here to consider: Surplus and Thresh. Surplus
      supports a niche playstyle so we'll craft a roll around it. Thresh doesn't
      seem to be all that game-changing (1-3% Super bonus on kill) and doesn't
      synergize with other perks, so we're skipping it.

          To hit `100` Recoil you're going to need to use a Counterbalance mod,
          which is par for the course on scattershot weapons (Autos, SMGs,
          etc.). There are several perks in the final columns that work well,
          and any combination of them would be terrific.

      There's not much to puzzle out here. In PvE you're going for as much
      `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. There are some solid
      perks here not in our rolls, becase you don't need this wishlist to tell
      you that Demolitionist is a decent perk!

          In seasons where Pulse Rifles end up with Barrier mods, Genesis
          will proc when the shield breaks while you'll wrecking the champions
          with Vorpal. Other "shields" will also proc Genesis, for example
          "Enlightened" enemies in the Garden of Salvation raid.
