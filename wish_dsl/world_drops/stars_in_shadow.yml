    summary: >
      Stars in Shadow is a 340 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Energy Pulse Rifle
      introduced in Destiny 2 Year 4 (Beyond Light). See
      [how it compares](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=B6PI-k;BIfK-Z;BFN60K;)
      to the existing High-Impacts that lit up in Season 11. It's a Crucible
      drop and if you're an avid PvP player, you'll be swimming in these rolls
      in no time. It's a solid Pulse Rifle with good base stats, a clean sight
      and a great feel. I'm sure you'll see more coverage in the coming weeks
      as people settle in to Beyond Light and Season 12.


      These rolls are going to be similar to those we captured in our
      coverage of
      [Cold Denial](#cold-denial---pvp)
      as it's a comparable 340 RPM.


      ***"Why are the odds for these rolls so low?"***

      
      The final two columns typically have four to six perks in them. In the
      case of Stars in Shadow, they each have twelve.


      ***"Why don't you have any rolls with Thresh?"***


      Thresh doesn't seem to be all that game-changing (1-3% Super bonus on
      kill) and doesn't synergize with other perks, so we're skipping it.


      ***"Why don't you have any Outlaw or Feeding Frenzy PvP rolls?"***

      
      Good question! Glove mod slots are inexpensive and not contentious in
      PvP. If you want much faster reload, throw on a two-Energy Pulse Rifle
      Reload mod. Feeding Frenzy was changed to provide a noticeable benefit
      after three successive kills, so I no longer recommend it for PvP.

          This set of rolls is all about maxing out Recoil, and keeps
          `Arrowhead Brake` constant as our barrel. You have the option of
          achieving `100` Recoil by slotting in a Counterbalance mod. If not,
          go nuts with your nearly perfectly vertical `94`. `Killing Wind` is
          S-tier and you'd be happy to get any of the final column perks.

          This set of rolls pivots around `Firmly Planted`. It means that, even
          on console we can opt for `Range`-boosting perks because `Firmly
          Planted` gives us all the `Stability` we need.

          This set of rolls pivots around `Surplus`. It provides a roughly
          25%, 13% and 8% boost depending on how many abilities are charged.
          You really want to be shooting for
          all three abilities charged at once which means either foregoing their
          use entirely or perhaps investing in high tiers of the respective
          stat (Strength, Discipline, or <class stat>) so that you can quickly
          recharge a single one. The tradeoff is going around with a
          supercharged weapon the whole match.

      In PvE you're going for as much `Range` as you can get with sustained
      damage upkeep. There are some solid perks here not in our rolls, becase
      you don't need this wishlist to tell you that Demolitionist is a good
      perk 🙃
