  summary: >
    We're going for straight-up recoil and massive stability here. We can get
    Recoil to 100 with Arrowhead and a Counterbalance mod so the rest is about
    stability. With a huge mag, 100 recoil and a lot of stability with
    Vorpal, this should be able to shut down some supers!

    We're looking for ways to keep increased DPS for longer, with Osmosis thrown
    in for high-end PvE w/Match Game and while I'm not super impressed with
    Vorpal on this weapon, why not in case it doesn't come back? I don't have a
    roll that just features Osmosis or Vorpal in case you want those for specific
    purposes, but you don't need a wishlist file to tell you to look for one perk ;)
    All of the available masterworks are fine; none required for a great roll.
    Here we go!
